He has testified in Olympia and met with state and federal policymakers to promote early learning and home visiting as key crime prevention strategies. His Guest Commentary in the Seattle Times and testimony before the Seattle City Council helped build public and political support for early learning at the state and local level.\n\nIn testimony before the Senate Early Learning and K-12 Committee in Olympia, Sheriff Urquhart said \"We can't arrest our way out of society's problems. We have to come up with other solutions. One of these solutions is high quality early learning.\"\n\nFight Crime: Invest in Kids Washington is a nonprofit, bipartisan, anti-crime organization led by over 225 police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecuting attorneys and violence survivors.\n\nCity issues phone fraud alert\n\nThe Mercer Island Police Department warns residents of yet another phone scam currently underway on the Island. Several residents have reported receiving similar phonecalls from individuals who claim they are with \"Windows,\" the Microsoft operating system common to most computers.\n\nThis new scam seeks to get recipients to download malicious software. Residents are always advised to hang up, not engage in any conversation, and certainly not call back to any phone numbers provided.

They were replaced to 100-watt metal halide lamps with new energy efficient LED lamps that use just 35 watts each. That first phase of the project, partly funded by a grant from Puget Sound Energy, is on track to pay back in just over two years.\n\nThis month, Phase 2 is underway as City crews gradually retrofit up to 70 of the taller street lamps, removing the old sodium vapor bulbs and replacing them with new LED bulbs. The light produced by LED lamps is much crisper, plus the bulbs last three to four times as long and use about 50 percent less power.", "sim": 0.4666666686534882, "wgt": 2, "time": "00:18:00", "uri": "237905855", "url": "http://www.mi-reporter.com/news/287027131.html", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "News briefs | Sheriff Urquhart is honored"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "15821", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"id": "16038", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"id": "16751", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game developer"}}, {"id": "16846", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17235", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo"}}, {"id": "17242", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"id": "17244", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_mining", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold mining"}}, {"id": "19341", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"id": "20551", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"id": "68122", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Ltd.", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rare Ltd."}}, {"id": "95557", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_Instinct_(video_game_series)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Killer Instinct (video game series)"}}, {"id": "163246", "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Spencer", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Spencer"}}, {"id": "251913", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battletoads", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battletoads"}}, {"id": "256358", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_Dark", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perfect Dark"}}, {"id": "717886", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerstar Golf"}}], "categories": [{"id": 89, "label": "dmoz/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 91, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 92, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 94, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 95, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 99, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 100, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 644, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Games", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25475812", "source": {"id": "1270", "uri": "www.gamekicker.com", "title": "www.gamekicker.com"}, "eventUri": "eng-1243620", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "As of right now, Microsoft has, without a doubt, the weakest first party lineup and stable of franchises in the industry.

Although raised as a C/C++ developer, for a long time I was a secret fan of Microsoft's C# language and the .NET framework. About three years ago, when I decided to leave the Wild West of C/C++-based graphics libraries and enter the civilized world of modern game engines, Unity stood out with one feature that made it an obvious choice for myself. Unity didn't require you to 'script' in one language (like Lua or UnrealScript) and 'program' in another. Instead, it had deep support for Mono, which meant all your programming could be done in any of the .NET languages. Oh joy! I finally had a legitimate reason to kiss C++ goodbye and have all my problems solved by automatic memory managment. This feature had been built deeply into the C# language and was an integral part of its philosophy. No more memory leaks, no more thinking about memory management! My life would become so much easier.\n\nIf you have even the most casual acquaintance with Unity and/or game programming, you know how wrong I was. I learned the hard way that in game developement, you cannot rely on automatic memory managment. If your game or middleware is sufficiently complex and resource-demanding, developing with C# in Unity is therefore a bit like walking a few steps backwards in the direction of C++. Every new Unity developer quickly learns that memory management is a problematic issue that cannot simply be entrusted to the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The Unity forums and many Unity-related blogs contain several collections of tips and best practices concerning memory. Unfortunately, not all of these are based on solid facts, and to the best of my knowledge, none of them are comprehensive. Furthermore, C# experts on sites such as Stackoverflow often seem to have little patience for the quirky, non-standard problems faced by Unity developers. For these reasons, in this and the following two blog posts, I try to give an overview and hopefully some in-depth knowlege on Unity-specific memory management issues in C#.\n\nI'm sure I've overlooked some important topics - mention them in the comments and I may write them up in a post-script.\n\nMost modern operating systems divide dynamic memory into stack and heap (1, 2), and many CPU architectures (including the one in your PC/Mac and your smartphone/tablet) support this division in their instruction sets. C# supports it by distinguishing value types (simple built-in types as well as user-defined types that are declared as or ) and reference types (classes, interfaces and delegates). Value types are allocated on the stack, reference types on the heap. The stack has a fixed size which is set at the start of a new thread. It's usually small - for instance, .NET threads on Windows default to a stack size of 1Mb. This memory is used to load the thread's main function and local variables, and subsequently load and unload functions (with their local variables) that are called from the main one. Some of it may be mapped to the CPU's cache to speed things up. As long as the call depth isn't excessively high or your local variables huge, you don't have to fear a stack overflow. And you see that this usage of the stack aligns nicely with the concept of structured programming.\n\nIf objects are too big to fit on the stack, or if they have to outlive the function they were created in, the heap comes into play. The heap is 'everything else' - a section of memory that can (usually) grow as per request to the OS, and over which the program rules as it wishes. But while the stack is almost trivial to manage (just use a pointer to remember where the free section begins), the heap fragments as soon as the order in which you allocate objects diverges from the order in which you deallocate them. Think of the heap as a Swiss cheese where you have to remember all the holes! Not fun at all. Enter automatic memory management. The task of automated allocation - mainly, keeping track of all the holes in the cheese for you - is an easy one, and supported by virtually all modern programming languages. Much harder is the task of automatic deallocation, especially deciding when an object is ready for deallocation, so that you don't have to.\n\nThis latter task is called garbage collection (GC). Instead of you telling your runtime environment when an object's memory can be freed, the runtime keeps track of all the references to an object and is thereby able to determine - at certain intervals - when an object cannot possibly be reached anymore from your code. Such an object can then be destroyed and it's memory gets freed. GC is still actively researched by academics, which explains why the GC architecture has changed and improved significantly in the .NET framework since version 1.0. However, Unity doesn't use .NET but it's open-source cousin, Mono, which continues to lag behind it's commercial counterpart. Furthermore, Unity doesn't default to the latest version (2.11 / 3.0) of Mono, but instead uses version 2.6 (to be precise, 2.6.5 on my Windows install of Unity 4.2.2 [EDIT: the same is true for Unity 4.3]). If you are unsure about how to verify this yourself, I will discuss it in the next blog post.\n\nOne of the major revisions introduced into Mono after version 2.6 concerned GC. New versions use generational GC, whereas 2.6 still uses the less sophisticated Boehm garbage collector. Modern generational GC performs so well that it can even be used (within limits) for real-time applications such as games. Boehm-style GC, on the other hand, works by doing an exhaustive search for garbage on the heap at relatively 'rare' intervals (i.e., usually much less frequently than once-per-frame in a game). It therefore has an overwhelming tendency to create drops in frame-rate at certain intervals, thereby annoying your players. The Unity docs recommend that you call whenever your game enters a phase where frames-per-second matter less (e.g., loading a new level or displaying a menu). However, for many types of games such opportunities occur too rarely, which means that the GC might kick in before you want it too. If this is the case, your only option is to bite the bullet and manage memory yourself. And that's what the remainder of this post and the following two posts are about!\n\nLet's be clear about what it means to 'manage memory yourself' in the Unity / .NET universe. Your power to influence how memory is allocated is (fortunately) very limited. You get to choose whether your custom data structures are (always allocated on the heap) or (allocated on the stack unless they are contained within a class), and that's it. If you want more magical powers, you must use C#'s keyword. But code is just unverifiable code, meaning that it won't run in the Unity Web Player and probably some other target platforms. For this and other reasons, don't use . Because of the above-mentioned limits of the stack, and because C# arrays are just syntactic sugar for (which is a class), you cannot and should not avoid automatic heap allocation. What you should avoid are unnecessary heap allocations, and we'll get to that in the next (and last) section of this post.\n\nYour powers are equally limited when it comes to deallocation. Actually, the only process that can deallocate heap objects is the GC, and its workings are shielded from you. What you can influence is when the last reference to any of your objects on the heap goes out of scope, because the GC cannot touch them before that. This limited power turns out to have huge practical relevance, because periodic garbage collection (which you cannot suppress) tends to be very fast when there is nothing to deallocate. This fact underlies the various approaches to object pooling that I discuss in the third post.\n\nA common suggestion which I've come across many times in the Unity forums and elsewhere is to avoid loops and use or loops instead. The reasoning behind this seems sound at first sight. Foreach is really just syntactic sugar, because the compiler will preprocess code such as this:\n\n...into something like the the following:\n\nIn other words, each use of creates an enumerator object - an instance of the interface - behind the scenes. But does it create this object on the stack or on the heap? That turns out to be an excellent question, because both are actually possible! Most importantly, almost all of the collection types in the namespace (, etc.) are smart enough to return a struct from from their implementation of ). This includes the version of the collections that ships with Mono 2.6.5 (as used by Unity).\n\n[EDIT] Matthew Hanlon pointed my attention to an unfortunate (yet also very interesting) discrepancy between Microsoft's current C# compiler and the older Mono/C# compiler that Unity uses 'under the hood' to compile your scripts on-the-fly. You probably know that you can use Microsoft Visual Studio to develop and even compile Unity/Mono compatible code. You just drop the respective assembly into the 'Assets' folder. All code is then executed in a Unity/Mono runtime environment. However, results can still differ depending on who compiled the code! loops are just such a case, as I've only now figured out. While both compilers recognize whether a collection's returns a or a , the Mono/C# has a bug which 'boxes' (see below, on boxing) a -enumerator to create a reference type.\n\nDo anonymous methods and lambdas cause memory leaks? The answer is: it depends. The C# compiler actually has two very different ways of handling them. To understand the difference, consider the following small chunk of code:\n\nOf course, the chief reason why closures and other language features where introduced in C# 3.0 is LINQ. If closures can lead to memory leaks, is it safe to use LINQ in your game? I may be the wrong person to ask, as I have always avoided LINQ like the plague. Parts of LINQ apparently will not work on operating systems that don't support just-in-time compilation, such as iOS. But from a memory aspect, LINQ is bad news anyway. An incredibly basic expression like the following:\n\n... allocates 68 Bytes on my system in every frame (28 via and 40 via )! The culprit here isn't even closures but extension methods to : LINQ has to create intermediary arrays to arrive at the final result, and doesn't have a system in place for recycling them afterwards. That said, I am not an expert on LINQ and I do not know if there are components of it that can be used safely within a real-time environment.\n\nIf you launch a coroutine via , you implicitly allocate both an instance of Unity's class (21 Bytes on my system) and an Enumerator (16 Bytes). Importantly, no allocation occurs when the coroutine s or resumes, so all you have to do to avoid a memory leak is to limit calls to while the game is running.\n\nNo overview of memory issues in C# and Unity would be complete without mentioning strings. From a memory standpoint, strings are strange because they are both heap-allocated and immutable. When you concatenate two strings (be they variables or string-constants) as in:\n\n... the runtime has to allocate at least one new string object that contains the result. In this is done efficiently via an external method called , but there is no way of getting around the heap allocation (40 Bytes on my system in the example above). If you need to modify or concatenate strings at runtime, use .\n\nSometimes, data have to be moved between the stack and the heap. For example, when you format a string as in:\n\n... you are calling a method with the following signature:\n\nIn other words, the integer \"5\" and the floating-point number \"5.0f\" have to be cast to when is called. But is a reference type whereas the other two are value types. C# therefore has to allocate memory on the heap, copy the values to the heap, and hand a reference to the newly created and objects. This process is called boxing, and its counterpart unboxing.\n\nThis behavior may not be a problem with because you expect it to allocate heap memory anway (for the new string). But boxing can also show up at less expected locations. A notorious example occurs when you want to implement the equality operator \"\" for your home-made value types (for example, a that represents a complex number). Read all about how to avoid hidden boxing in such cases here.\n\nTo wind up this post, I want to mention that various library methods also conceal implicit memory allocations. The best way to catch them is through profiling. Two interesting cases which I've recently come across are these:\n\n***\n\nThere are other memory traps which could be written about. However, I don't want to give you any more fish, but teach you how to catch your own fish. Thats what the next post is about!\n\nPart 2\n\nPart 3", "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "wgt": 2, "time": "00:22:00", "uri": "237906261", "url": "http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/WendelinReich/20131109/203841/C_Memory_Management_for_Unity_Developers_part_1_of_3.php", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Best of 2014: C# memory management for Unity developers"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "16038", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"id": "16640", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing platform"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17242", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"id": "17433", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"id": "17484", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"id": "18068", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xbox"}}, {"id": "26656", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Play", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Remote Play"}}, {"id": "26917", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embedded system"}}, {"id": "163246", "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Spencer", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Spencer"}}], "categories": [{"id": 70, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 92, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 486, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 547, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 915, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25475849", "source": {"id": "1270", "uri": "www.gamekicker.com", "title": "www.gamekicker.com"}, "eventUri": "eng-1245403", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Phil Spencer has already confirmed that he will be attending the Windows 10 event that Microsoft is holding next month, and that there will be some good gaming related announcements there next month; at the same time, there have also already been leaks regarding some sort of Xbox/Windows connectivity.

(IBS) to demonstrate their Sapphire Build and Microsoft Dynamics software solutions for the homebuilding industry. The Sapphire Build/Dynamics SL solution is truly the only fully integrated operational and financial management system for residential homebuilders. The solution provides full collaboration between builders and their trade partners, homebuyers, and the field. SBS Group has been working with Sapphire Build since 2008 and has built a national network of clients who build in excess of 10,000 homes per year. Our client, American West Development from Las Vegas, Nevada will be on hand to present details of their implementation of Microsoft Dynamics SL and the business benefits the company has seen.\n\nDemos will highlight the integrations between Sapphire Build and Microsoft Dynamics SL and how companies have successfully utilized the solution. Be sure to check out the demonstrations at booth C3056 and our drawings for a new Lenovo tablet PC. We will also be announcing a brand new capital leasing program designed for builders that will allow the total cost of ownership to be spread over time in order to minimize the up-front investment.\n\nIBS will be held January 20-26, 2015 at the Las Vegas Convention Center. The 2015 show will again feature a partnership between the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and the National Kitchen & Bath Association (NKBA) hosting the second annual Design & Construction Week.

capitalists believe that 2015 will be a year of tumult and (in public markets anyway) triumph for the startup world.\n\nHere are the visions that the general partners, managing directors and partners from firms such as NEA, IVP, Cue Ball Group,General Catalyst Partners and MDV have when they gaze into their crystal balls.\n\nTogether these firms have more than $22 billion under management, so they're not only seeing the future, they're often shaping it.\n\nCloud Wars - The Empires Strike Back: The cloud computing wars started years ago, but, largely speaking, Amazon has been uncontested and has quietly become the dominant player in the space. In 2015, Amazon will face a multi-front war as Google will launch its assault on Amazon's traditionally strong presence in the developer ecosystem, and Microsoft will combat Amazon in the enterprise market by re-doubling its efforts on Azure.\n\nLegacy Titanics - Icebergs Ahead: We will see more \"unbundling\" of legacy software companies. The disruptive forces that have pushed HP and Symantec to break up their operations in order to compete with new entrants will accelerate as activist investors and private equity owners push to maximize the value of these existing assets. Look for significant moves from Microsoft, EMC, VMware, Citrix, and Dell in the next year.\n\nThe Promise of Payments: Despite heightened focus, increased investment dollars and strong media buzz around a revolution in the payments space, there has been relatively little tangible change in the way we pay for things. NFC payment hasn't taken off despite the introduction of Apple Pay, POS integrations are incredibly fragmented and interchange fees are being driven toward zero.\n\nWearables Weren't Quite Ready: There was much excitement around wearable technology, but practical usage isn't quite there so adoption has been low. While there were some notable product releases, wide-spread adoption and everyday use is still not at hand. For that to happen, creators need to figure out use cases and applications that genuinely simplify everyday tasks, rather than complicate them. 2015 will feature greater entrepreneurial enablement. For example:\n\nBigger, Better Deals: With a 21 percent decline in funds but a 40 percent increase in dollars raised, we are seeing larger funds spread across fewer firms. In 2015 we can expect to see the average deal size increase with an uptick in later growth rounds.\n\nTech Enablement Creates More Entrepreneurs: Real-time and mobile services have empowered a new segment of workforce that thrives on flexible and independent work. This has enabled those that aren't able to (or simply don't want to) fulfill 9-5 jobs to enter the workforce and creates a prevalence of non-traditional careers in services. In 2014 in the U.S. alone, there are 18 million independent workers. Expect that number to increase at sharp rates in 2015.\n\nGovernment Empowers & Creates Even More Entrepreneurs: 2014 saw changes in policy that enable the entrepreneur with greater independence and freedom. More lenient immigration policies will allow people to pursue entrepreneurship, while affordable individual health care makes traditional employment less of a draw. These policy changes will drive a massive influx of entrepreneurs in 2015 and beyond.\n\nDeconstruction Of Traditional IT Applications: Independent of whether this will be driven by startups or by Google, there will be a shift in how and where companies do business in the future leveraging SaaS models and moving away from the stranglehold of traditional ENT software vendors like Microsoft, Oracle, SAP and others.\n\nNetwork Virtualization: Virtualization will continue to rise in popularity and finally take the main stage in networking - we have seen this starting to take place with the acquisition of Nicira and ACE.\n\nThere Will Be Hacks: As we move into 2015, security breaches will continue to happen as companies work to patch holes in current software and networks. Trying to stay one step ahead of hackers with the latest software or security features isn't going to be enough; companies will need to work together in order to combat and fight them off.\n\nThe End Of The 'Superstore' In Verticals: First it was Circuit City, then Radio Shack, followed by Best Buy. There is still a place for Walmart and grocery stores but not vertical players in alternative commerce. That is were the web and mobile win. With companies like The Honest Company, there will be a rise of vertical commerce with a unique connection to the customer directly.\n\nThe Downside To Consolidation And Failure Of Media Properties: Consumers realize that this isn't a good thing -- AT&T plus Direct TV, Comcast plus Time Warner Cable. The fewer people there are to compete on the price of cable, phone and, most importantly, high-speed data, as well as provide thoughtful journalistic integrity is a concern and the consumers will realize this in 2015.\n\nNew Enterprise Trend: Labor and Workforce Innovation: Until a decade ago, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) were relegated to research labs, technical publications, and big-budget science fiction films. ML and AL have \"crossed the chasm\" and will have a profound impact on the way businesses work. Pairing human workers with machine learning and automation will transform knowledge work and unleash new levels of human productivity and creativity. Without the advances in automation, the swelling volume of data would overwhelm knowledge workers and cripple businesses.\n\nA New Era in Retail and Commerce Innovation: The traditional retail infrastructure and supply chain logistics as we know it is being disrupted by companies creating new technology platforms and data-enabled distribution systems that have predictive analytics, better customer profiling, deeper consumer engagement, blended online and offline data, and more agile supply chains. The supply-chain has been fragmented and inefficient for years, particularity with the delivery of heavyweight goods to the consumer, which until now have been expensive and complex. E-commerce platforms are being transformed for the consumer and the manufacturer by leveraging powerful analytics and forecasting tools helping to alleviate \"last mile\" (i.e. from warehouse to consumer) problem that is the key logistics issue - where most of the cost, complexity and fragmentation lies, especially with the delivery of heavyweight items.\n\nLife Tech Will Take on New Life: In life, time really is money, and a major source of time is spent on home and family tasks. Life tech allows digitally-enabled services, intelligent personal agents and mobile-device-enabled communication and collaboration infrastructure to truly optimize consumers' lives. Similar to how ERP helped to organize the business side of our lives, life tech promises to organize the personal side of our lives In addition to companies like Nest. Other companies, such as TicketFly and Ruby Ribbon, have products and services that optimize, personalize and automate our lives as consumers and are creating a smart world that shifts and responds to our needs.\n\nThe IPO Market: The IPO market will stay open, but a large number of tech companies will price their IPOs below the price of their last private financings.\n\nTech IPOs: I think 2015 will be the best year since the 'bubble' for venture-backed tech IPOs. We have had a solid year in 2014 and the deals late this year are working well. There is considerable institutional investor appetite; they have made good returns on tech IPOs this year. Most importantly, there are an unprecedented number of high-quality, private, venture-backed tech companies of real scale ($50 million or more in annual revenues) and growth (30-50 percent top-line growth).", "sim": 0.3529411852359772, "wgt": 2, "time": "01:23:00", "uri": "237911994", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/31/7-venture-capitalists-predict-what-will-happen-in-2015/?ncid=rss",

"eng-1245497", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "A reader laments a year full of disappointment and broken promises, but sees plenty of hope that 2015 will be a significant improvement.\n\n2014 has been disappointing for gaming on a number of levels, with several games not living up to early hype, and others getting released in a broken state. Of all the console manufacturers I would say Nintendo had the best year, with the Wii U finally producing some top notch games like Mario Kart 8 and Super Smash Bros.\n\nSony and Microsoft may have sold a staggering amount of new consoles, but their game output has been slow and fairly lacklustre in comparison. There were no stand-out titles that were universally praised, with journalists reviews varying wildly, which made choosing a game more difficult.\n\nIt is quite a sad indictment of last year's games, that some of the top rated titles of 2014 have been remasters from the last console generation. With The Last Of Us and GTA V being the best of the bunch. It seems that a lot of publishers are jumping on the bandwagon with upgraded versions of Sleeping Dogs, Metro Redux, and Halo: The Master Chief Collection all hitting shelves for the new generation of consoles, with other titles planned for next year.\n\nThe Master Chief Collection is also a prime example of another bugbear of 2014, the releasing of unfinished and broken games. Battlefield 4 started it off at the end of last year with a disastrous launch of a game, that was riddled with bugs and glitches, that took the best part of a year to fix. In 2014 we've had the Master Chief Collection, which is having major problems with online matchmaking, with many disgruntled gamers asking for refunds.\n\nSony have had the Driveclub fiasco, where the long delayed title suffered from server issues that stopped players from playing online, and delayed the promised PS Plus version of the game. While Ubisoft have had a nightmare launch for Assassin's Creed Unity, which has been plagued by frame rate problems and serious bugs, making the game nearly unplayable for some players.\n\nThere were a lot of games that were hyped up last year, with Watch Dogs being hailed as a GTA killer, Destiny being touted as the revolution of the first person shooter, and The Evil Within marking the return of survival horror. Unfortunately none of these games lived up to the hype, with Watch Dogs receiving mixed reviews, although I know a few gamers that really enjoyed it.\n\nDestiny was far from being a revolution, but was a decent shooter with a poor story and repetitive gameplay. While The Evil Within was far from being a spiritual successor to Resident Evil 4.\n\nFor me Destiny was my biggest disappointment of the year. While the mechanics of the game were sound, the threadbare story was disappointing, especially after experiencing games like the Mass Effect series. The bullet sponge boss battles were also uninspiring, and the reusing of enemies and levels meant that the battles quickly became a chore, rather than a challenge. While it can be a lot of fun when you play with friends, compared to Borderlands 1 and 2 it is all pretty dull.\n\nWhile it has been a disappointing year, there have been a few titles that I have really enjoyed. The new Wolfenstein was a great game, that was a nice amalgamation of the old style shooters with the new. It was good to go back to a World War setting, which has been neglected recently in favour of the modern day and futuristic themes.\n\nI also really enjoyed the new Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare, which really benefited from a three year development cycle. The single-player was a lot of fun, with plenty of blockbuster bombast, and a decent variety to the levels. Although some of the set pieces had a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu about them. The addition of the EXO suit to the multiplayer was inspired though, and added extra verticality and unpredictability to the multiplayer. With a decent selection of well-designed maps rounding out the package.\n\nWith the majority of big budget games disappointing in one capacity or another during 2014 the resurgence of indie games showed that creativity isn't dead in gaming, with several outstanding releases including Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition, with it's stunning art style, inventive combos, and platforming.\n\nWith games like No Man's Sky looking like raising the bar for indie games next year, and big budget titles like the new Zelda, The Division, Uncharted 4, and Star Wars: Battlefront showing promise I have high hopes that 2015 will see the new consoles finally hitting their stride.\n\nA very merry Christmas to all at GC, and to the readers and contributors that make the site such a joy throughout the year.\n\nBy reader Cubes (PSN ID)/Cubes73 (NN ID/Steam ID)/Kevin M\n\nThe reader's feature does not necessary represent the views of GameCentral or Metro.\n\nYou can submit your own 500 to 600-word reader feature at any time, which if used will be published in the next appropriate weekend slot.

"body": "Two Florida men say Apple misrepresented how much storage space iOS 8 uses on iPhones, iPads, and iPods.\n\nTwo Florida men are suing Apple over what they claim is a misrepresentation of how much storage space the iOS 8 operating system uses on iPhones, iPads, and iPods.\n\nPaul Orshan and Christopher Endara filed their class-action complaint on Tuesday in a California federal court, Bloomberg reported. PCMag has also obtained a copy of the filing.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking $5 million from Apple to distribute among class-action participants.\n\nThe suit states that Apple \"fails to disclose to consumers that as much as 23.1 percent of the advertised storage capacity of the Devices will be consumed by iOS 8 and unavailable for consumers when consumers purchase Devices that have iOS 8 installed. Reasonable consumers, such as Plaintiff, do not expect this marked discrepancy between the advertised level of capacity and the available capacity of the Devices, as the operating system and other storage space unavailable to consumers occupies an extraordinary percentage of their Devices' limited storage capacity.\"\n\nThe complaint also links the limited unused storage space on devices running iOS 8 with Apple's marketing of its iCloud storage service.\n\n\"To compound the harm to consumers, after Defendant provides materially less than the advertised capacity on the Devices, Defendant aggressively markets a monthly fee-based storage system called iCloud,\" the lawsuit states. \"Using these sharp business tactics, Defendant gives less storage capacity than advertised, only to offer to sell that capacity in a desperate moment, e.g., when a consumer is trying to record or take photos at a child or grandchild's recital, basketball game or wedding. To put this in context, each gigabyte of storage Apple shortchanges its customers amounts to approximately 400-500 high resolution photographs.\"\n\nIt's not clear how far Orshan and Endara will get with this case. Apple accurately represents the total storage capacity of the devices it sells, but the software that runs them must necessarily take up at least some of that capacity. Other device makers advertise the storage capacity of their products similarly, listing the total capacity instead of what's available after the OS and other pre-loaded software is installed.\n\nIn 2012, Microsoft faced a similar suit over storage on its Surface tablet. The following year, a judge granted Microsoft's request for arbitration.\n\nFor more, check out PCMag's roundup of iOS 8 tips in the slideshow above.", "sim": 0.7450980544090271, "wgt": 2, "time":

Sony Pictures said on Wednesday that it had expanded distribution of the controversial comedy \"The Interview\" to include more theaters and video-on-demand platforms, after hackers threatened to attack cinemas screening the film.\n\nFrom Friday, a total of 580 independent theaters will show \"The Interview\" - a madcap satire about a fictional CIA plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un.\n\nThreats by hackers issued after a November cyberattack on Sony Pictures initially prompted the movie giant to cancel the film's Christmas Day release, after many large US theater chains got cold feet.\n\nThe United States has blamed North Korea for the cyber attack, but Pyongyang has vehemently denied any involvement.\n\nThe comedy, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, eventually opened on December 25 in more than 300 independent movie houses that offered to show the film after Sony came under fire for pulling it.\n\nIt was also made available last week on Google Play, YouTube Movies, Microsoft's Xbox Video and on a dedicated website, www.seetheinterview.com.\n\nSony said the film would now also be available from Wednesday either as video on demand or pay-per-view via major US cable and satellite providers including Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cablevision and Verizon FiOS.\n\nThe film price starts at $5.99.\n\n\"The Interview\" will also be available on Sony's PlayStation Network from Thursday.\n\n\"We have always sought the widest possible distribution for 'The Interview,' and want to thank our new partners for helping us make that happen,\" said Sony Pictures boss Michael Lynton.\n\nSo far, the film has earned a combined $18 million in online rentals or purchases, as well as theater ticket sales, since its release.", "sim": 0.7686274647712708,

false, "body": "LOTS of cool new technology products come out every year, but usually only a few stand out. These few, though, are often mind-bending -- they alter your perspective of what's possible in the future. There were four such technologies for me in 2014:\n\nDJI INSPIRE 1 Imagine taking control of an evil dragonfly that can record everything it sees. Then you'll have some approximation of what it's like to fly the Inspire 1, a remote-controlled quadricopter released in the fall by the drone-maker DJI. The machine, which sells for about $3,000, is agile and powerful when in flight and offers a few unusual features. Its attached high-definition camera hangs a few inches underneath its body, allowing it to capture an unobstructed picture in any direction. The bird can be operated by two remote controls -- one to control flight, and the other to control the camera.\n\nRomeo Durscher, a drone pilot who works at DJI, let me take control of the Inspire 1 during a test flight over the San Francisco peninsula just before Thanksgiving. As he described all the serious uses for the bird -- especially for photographers and videographers who've long yearned for a cheap alternative to helicopters for aerial imagery -- I became hooked. It's hard to think of a more visceral pleasure in tech than a machine that can dart across the sky at your will. Welcome to the terrifying thrill of the drone age.\n\nOCULUS RIFT'S CRESCENT BAY In March, Facebook announced that it would spend $2 billion to acquire Oculus, a start-up whose virtual-reality headset has generated huge interest. The company's progress since then has cemented the logic of the acquisition: Oculus's virtual-reality tech just keeps getting more and more realistic.\n\nOne huge problem in virtual reality is motion sickness. If your eyes see a picture that looks just slightly out of sync with your perception of motion, you're going to feel a little queasy. In September, Oculus showed its latest prototype, Crescent Bay, that can track a user's head in a complete 360-degree swivel, allowing for a sense of being immersed in a picture that observers called \"mind-blowing.\" When I tested an earlier prototype alongside a more sophisticated virtual-reality machine at Stanford University in the fall, I felt pretty much the same thing. Virtual reality sounds like a gimmick, until you try it; then you'll understand why, in the future, we might often escape reality.\n\nSKYPE TRANSLATOR The universal translator that can automatically bridge any language barrier has long been a staple of science fiction. Now it's almost here, at least in a limited, but still quite impressive, demonstration. Skype, the popular video-calling service owned by Microsoft, unveiled in December a preview version of Skype Translator, which performs near-instantaneous voice translation between people speaking English and Spanish. You can call up a business contact in Mexico and say, \"Hello,\" and she'll hear a friendly, Siri-like voice say, \"Hola!\" on the other end.\n\nBut it goes deeper. In Microsoft's demonstration, students in Mexico City and Tacoma, Wash., were able to understand each other well enough to play a guessing game. After trying out the preview, Peter Bright, a writer at Ars Technica, called it \"breathtaking.\" He added: \"It's like science fiction has come to life.\"\n\nSkype Translator is the product of Microsoft's deep investments in machine learning and natural-language processing. Because those processes only get better as more people use them, services like Skype Translator are bound to get much better.\n\nGOOGLE'S IMAGE SUMMARIES A few young men in shorts and T-shirts are standing on a wide-open green field, all posed as if they're in motion, and between then, in midair, is a small white orb that appears to be made out of plastic and seems to be spinning. How would you describe this scene in a few words? If you're human, it likely won't take you more than a few milliseconds to come up with a caption: \"A group of young people playing a game of Frisbee.\"\n\nBut if you're a computer, translating such an image into words has long been out of reach. Until now. In November, Google showed off the results of an artificial intelligence project that can look at an image consisting of common items and describe, in comprehensible English words, what's going on in the picture -- often with startling accuracy. Given a picture of two pizzas sitting on a white kitchen stove, the machine spit out, \"Two pizzas sitting on top of a stovetop oven.\" It did as well identifying a group of elephants, a guy riding a dirt bike and thousands of other such images.\n\nThe system uses a neural network, an artificial intelligence system that mimics the human brain, and which Google has used, in the past, to identify cats in YouTube videos. It still isn't perfect, though. Given a picture of a road sign covered in stickers, the computer saw \"a refrigerator filled with lots of food and drinks.\"", "sim": 0.4823529422283173, "wgt": 2, "time": "02:05:00", "uri": "237915251", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/technology/personaltech/standouts-in-tech-drones-virtual-reality-instant-translation-and-ai.html", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Standouts in Tech: Drones, Virtual Reality, Instant Translation and A.I."}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "16029", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email address"}}, {"id": "16038", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"id": "16308", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer network"}}, {"id": "16454", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"id": "16677", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17433", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"id": "17484", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"id": "18090", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"id": "27711", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"id": "30092", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_controller", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game controller"}}, {"id": "40367", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_(computing)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mouse (computing)"}}, {"id": "40797", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software development kit"}}, {"id": "256923", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kinect"}}, {"id": "262075", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"id": "801991", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_hardware", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox 360 hardware"}}], "categories": [{"id": 44, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 70, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 486, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 915, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25479511", "source": {"id": "1380", "uri": "www.techworld.com.au", "title": "TechWorld"}, "eventUri": null, "isDuplicate": true, "body": "Now that the Kinect for Windows v2 is out, Microsoft will be selling out its stock of the first-generation motion-based controller\n\nMicrosoft will stop selling the original Kinect for Windows in 2015 now that the second generation of the motion-based controller platform is available.\n\nIn a blog post, Microsoft advised enterprises that need large numbers of the old systems for existing applications to contact the company as soon as possible.\n\n\"We will do our best to fill your orders, but no more original sensors will be manufactured after the current stock sells out,\" the Kinect for Windows Team wrote in the post.\n\nThe phase-out of the original product doesn't come as a surprise, since Microsoft introduced the Kinect for Windows v2 and a second-generation software development kit, SDK 2.0, earlier this year.\n\nKinect for Windows brought motion-based interaction technology to PCs and tablets, offering new ways of controlling applications beyond the typical mouse and keyboard. Kinect senses depth using twin cameras and can interpret movements and gestures.\n\nKinect for Windows v2 adds full 1080p video, an expanded field of view and better body tracking, among other improvements, according to Microsoft.\n\nGamers were the first to use Kinect when it was introduced for the Xbox 360 console in 2010. The technology has since been applied to uses in health care, retail, manufacturing and other fields.\n\nStephen Lawson covers mobile, storage and networking technologies for The IDG News Service.

"title": "www.gizmodo.com.au"}, "eventUri": "eng-1245414", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "The smartphone in your pocket today makes whatever handset you had just two years ago look laughably bad. That's not just because of better sensors and better software; the apps that power them have improved in kind.\n\nIn 2014, these new iOS, Android, and Windows Phone apps were 100 per cent worth downloading. Some improved dramatically on existing ideas, others took what was once incredibly complex and made it simple, and a few just did cool shit. Whatever the case, smartphone apps took another step forward this year, and with what we already know that's in our future (Windows 10, anyone?), I can't wait to see what's next.\n\nFor the best app games, check out the iOS and Android picks from our friends at Kotaku.\n\nWorkflow\n\nWorkflow is the perfect example of keeping it simple (stupid). Apps like Drafts have given iOS users automation abilities for some time now, but Workflow simplifies that process and makes it much more accessible for your average, everyday iPhone user. For those whole like to embrace the promise that technology truly can make our lives easier, Workflow is a must. [iOS]\n\nSnowball Beta\n\nOn my smartphone I have SMS, Messenger, WhatsApp, Slack, and Hangouts. The amount of mpm (messages per minute) I receive is out of control, so I need an app to help tame the digital chaos. Enter: Snowball. The idea behind the app is simple -- corral all major messaging services into one place so you can browse and dismiss more easily. Snowball also adopts Facebook's chat heads so any message will always be present on your screen, and if you find chat heads annoying, you can just disable it. Plus, the app has a Yeti for a mascot, which is adorable. [Android]\n\nPhotomath\n\nMaths and I have a contentious relationship, meaning I pretty much suck at it. But if I had Photomath in high school, I might have stood a chance. Take a picture of maths equation with your camera, and boom -- the app churns out an answer with step-by-step analysis. It's more of a learning tool than a cheating tool, but I'm not going to tell you how to use it. [iOS and Windows Phone]\n\nHyperlapse\n\nFrom the creators of Instagram -- you know, that one app that has more users than Twitter -- comes Hyperlapse, the super-easy way to create time lapses on your iPhone. The beauty of the app is in its simplicity. Shoot a hyperlapse (or selfielapse), edit the speed, and that's it. What use to take professional photographers hours to complete just took you minutes. For free, it doesn't get much better than that. [iOS]\n\nWeTransfer\n\nSending large files on any device pretty much sucks. Email clients hit data caps, and you're left sending multiple emails, and compressing, compressing, compressing. There's a better way, and it's WeTransfer. The free app lets you send up to 10GB of data quick and easy. The app simply sends a download link to whatever or whomever you're trying to reach. It's a must-have if you're constantly slinging gigabytes among your various devices. [iOS and Android]\n\nMicrosoft Office\n\nUntil 2014, editing Microsoft documents on mobile devices made me want to cry. Bundled into an all encompassing app, the tools and abilities were drastically restricted and borderline pointless. Earlier in the year, Microsoft released Office for iPad and quickly followed up with mobile versions in the fall for iPhone. The app is completely redesigned to take advantage of the device you're using, and Microsoft also opened up a lot of features for free to users with only pro tools hiding behind a subscription. Who said you can't be productive on the go? [iOS]\n\nInbox\n\nThis year, Google tried to solve one of the hardest mobile software questions: Email. What it came up with was an Inbox, a separate app from standard email that integrates Mailbox-like snooze features and a more glance-friendly interface. The app is still languishing in an early invite-required beta, but out of the gate, it's a pretty impressive attempt. [ iOS and Android]\n\nReporter\n\nThe biggest headache with the quantified-self trend is remaining vigilant in logging data and keeping track of your activity. Reporter tries to simplify things by pinging you several times throughout the day and creating a short quiz for you to answer. Over time, Reporter begins churning out the stats behind your habits, and the best part is that it's real data you can use. Once you pay the $US4 premium, Reporter will transform you into numbers. [ iOS]\n\nXim\n\nThis year, Microsoft made sharing slideshows less of headache. With Xim, all you do is select photos, add contacts, and press send. Maybe the smartest part of this little app is only the person creating the slideshow needs to download it. Xim sends the slideshow as a link that opens up in a browser, so if your friends, family, or that fun drunk you met last night doesn't know a Xim from a zoo, no worries. The experience is also intimate since all participant actions are shared across devices in real time, like you're flipping through a photo album side-by-side. [iOS, Android, and Windows Phone]\n\nJibJab Messages\n\nThis one is out of left field, but JibJab Messages lets you star in your own bite-sized, ever-looping piece of GIF greatness, and it's incredibly addicting. After coughing up just a $US1 after the free trial, you get to make all the GIFs plastered with your (or your friend's) face you want -- and it's super easy to do. Snap a pic, or grab one from your camera roll, and be on your way. Will it help you organise your life? No. Be more productive? Definitely not. Is it fun as hell? You betcha. [ iOS]\n\nFireChat\n\nStrangely enough, FireChat isn't the most well-designed, eye-catching, or super useful app of 2014, but it was one of the few that actually made a real, tangible difference in the world. Hong Kong protesters used FireChat's mesh networks -- the offline tech that makes chatting with anyone nearby possible -- to send messages without cell reception. FireChat is the perfect app for protest organisers and crowds, but it's \"Nearby\" function only stretches about 30 feet or so. Regardless, it's a neat app worth having in your arsenal. [iOS and Android]\n\nOffice Lens\n\nDoing expense reports and just digitizing documents in general is the absolute worst, but Microsoft's Office Lens can snap your messy chicken scratch or printed docs and churn out a digital copy you can share or save to OneNote. BONUS: the photos are also OCR'ed, meaning the text is searchable. That's just all-around neat. [ Windows Phone]\n\nOvercast\n\nBecause of Serial, podcasts are cool again (jk, they have always been cool), and Overcast is the app to help you keep track of them all. The app also has awesome features like Voice Boost, which makes crappy-sounding podcasts less crappy-sounding, and Smart Speed that will cut out long periods of silence so you can actually do some damage to that backlog of podcasts you promised you'd catch up on. Oh, and if you want to make your own podcast, trying using another great app of 2014, Opinion. [iOS]\n\nAcorns\n\nOh man, investing. Every time I hear the word, I spontaneously get all sweaty and nervous. I'm terrible with money -- fact -- but Acorns helps me be less so. The app syncs with your credit and debit cards and rounds up every transaction to the nearest dollar, taking the change and making small micro investments. You can also select how aggressive or conservative you want to be with your investments. Acorns takes a $US1 fee every month you're actively investing and a negligible management fee, depending on how much you invest. And if you want to get more involved with investing and stocks, take a look at Robinhood, which is a well-designed app that offers zero-commission trading. [iOS and Android]\n\nKeezy Drummer\n\nMaking music is fun, and sometimes torturous, but mostly fun. That's the whole point of it, and Keezy Drummer perfectly encapsulates that idea. Through incredibly intuitive design and 12 different percussion samples, anyone (yes, even the musically challenged) can create beats that are actually pretty damn good. It's also addicting as hell, so that's a plus. [ iOS]\n\nFragment\n\nPhoto apps are the most bloated category on any smartphone platform (except maybe games), but no photo app looks quite like this. Fragment is an app specifically designed to add trippy after effects to your photos. It takes a little getting used to and spotting what kind of picture is a good candidate for Fragment's acid-laced recreations can be tricky, but once you get the hang of it, your Instagram \"likes\" are going to quickly multiply. [iOS and Android]\n\nPeek Calendar\n\nAh yes, calendars. iOS has tons of them, and with iOS 8/Maverick, even the stock option ain't so bad. But none of them looks like the $US2 Peek Calendar. Strangely enough, Peek would feel right at home with Google's Material Design, but this is an iOS-only affair. Peek makes your calendar as simple as possible, opting for gesture-based navigation rather than software buttons. There's a slight learning curve involved but it's worth it. It's best to listen to Yoda on this one: \"You must unlearn what you have learned.\" [ iOS]\n\nTheme+\n\nSometimes, you just want to make smartphones pretty, and Theme+ just does that. My absolute favourite feature on Windows Phone are those constantly animated Live Tiles, they offer infinite possibility for customisation and Theme+ is an app that lets you create beautiful backdrops for your homescreen. The app is $US1.29, but if the geometric designs are to your liking, it's worth the plunge. [Windows Phone]\n\nWire\n\nWire is the direction I want the future of messaging to take: beautifully designed, minimalist UI, and end-to-end encryption. Wire is my favourite messaging platform I've used this year outside of your general fare like Hangouts and iMessages. Wire does have a few things to fix, chief among them being video messaging, but the seamless way to share content, start voice calls, and chat in a great-looking messenger is the texting future I've been looking for. [iOS and Android]\n\nFacebook Rooms\n\nYes, we know. Another Facebook app. When I first heard about Rooms (and wrote about it), I wasn't sold at first. The idea seemed completely wrapped up in web 1.0 thinking, had absolutely no search feature, and the idea of using QR codes made me want to punch something. In December, the Rooms team added an Explore feature, so I decided to take another look. I have enough random hobbies (D&D, Japanese baseball, and collecting Fantastic Four comics from the 1960s) that rooms could be a very powerful tool. It does recreate that web 1.0 feeling where the internet made us all discover that we're not alone in what we like, and Rooms brings us together. [iOS]\n\nAccompli\n\n2014 saw lots of inbox innovation. Inbox by Gmail nabbed up most of the headlines, but Accompli, an email client for Android and iOS, is built to help you get some real work done. With easy access to your calendar, Microsoft Exchange support, and quick references to recently emailed contacts, Accompli is email at its most productive. Plus, Microsoft just bought them, so they most be onto something. If you're still searching for ways to get to inbox zero, Accompli can help. [iOS and Android]\n\nHERE Beta\n\nGoogle Maps is the reigning champ when it comes to smartphone cartography, but HERE Beta is going to try to upset the status quo. There are tons of reasons to love Nokia's mapping solution -- great design, simple interface, speed-limit warning features -- but its real claim to fame is it lets users download maps for offline use and can be used even without an internet connection. These maps also span the globe, making HERE Beta a pretty attractive option for people who find themselves abroad and don't want to rack up a fortune on their phone bill.

The goal is to make working in 3D as fast, accurate, and simple as it is to create 2D images today. Recent innovations in what is now called reality capture or digital reality could make 2015 the year that capture-based workflows go mainstream.\n\nThe appeal of collecting 3D data about real-world objects is wide-ranging: Product designers could easily \"borrow\" a natural shape. Engineers could reuse elements of an otherwise obsolete machine as the basis for a newer design. Old parts lacking digital design data could be scanned and archived. Scanning could replace measuring and modeling for reverse engineering.\n\nThe ability to capture and modify this data sounds practical and broadly useful, but its full potential has yet to be realized. The complexity of 3D data creation and use has hampered widespread adoption.\n\nThe crux of the problem is an inherent dissimilarity of data types: CAD software represents real-world objects using continuous vectors and/or coordinate solids; 3D scanners, in contrast, gather data as discrete points (voxels) represented as a spatial array (point clouds). To convert point clouds for use in 3D CAD requires multiple conversion steps, each requiring a specialized software product or tool within a larger conversion suite. For years these tools have been priced out of the reach of most product designers. In addition, each conversion step usually requires manual editing before moving on.\n\nWhen the 3D point cloud data finally arrives in CAD, the shape is accurate but much crucial information is lacking. Is the object a shell or a solid? Is a curve a bend or a weld? Is the hole 3 cm or 1\"? It can be a long process to create the final model. Large firms can afford dedicated staff to fix the models, but most engineering teams cannot.\n\nDeclining Hardware Prices, Increasing Software Power\n\nThe complexity of applying 3D data has been a greater hurdle than the financial outlay involved. Although cost is always a concern, solutions have been introduced for both the high-end professional and the consumer ends of the marketplace. For example, in 2006, a new handheld scanner suitable for professional engineering came to market at the breakthrough price of $39,000. Automotive OEMs and other Fortune 500 manufacturers snatched up the ZScanner 700, but a dearth of good editing tools prevented further market penetration.\n\nIn 2010, the Microsoft Kinect brought a subset of 3D scanning -- motion detection -- into the home. For $149 the Kinect turned the Xbox 360 into a game console controlled by a wave of the hand. After Microsoft released a free software development kit (SDK) and open-source programmers reverse-engineered a way to use the Kinect without the Xbox, researchers and hobbyists swarmed to the new platform. A variety of novel applications were created, but widespread adoption of the technology for 3D data gathering was again stymied by the complexity of working with 3D data (which was much less precise when generated by Kinect than by professional-level scanners).\n\nThe ZScanner 700 was a breakthrough 3D handheld scanner when it debuted in 2006 for $39,000.

years Craig Walker got a lot of puzzled looks about his chosen line of work: Selling voice-conferencing software. Few technologies are as mundane and ridiculed as the conference call. It is hardly the kind of Big Idea one would expect from the entrepreneur who ran a company that pioneered phone dialing for a web browser (DialPad, which Yahoo bought and turned into Yahoo Voice) and in 2006 created the first one-number-that-rings-everywhere-at-once service (GrandCentral, which Google bought and turned into Google Voice).\n\nWalker's three-year-old company, Switch Communications, has done fairly well with UberConference, a simple, PIN-free cloud service. It's coming up on 1 billion call minutes so far and grosses nearly $1 million per month from customers paying $10 a month for the premium version. But UberConference was never Walker's real objective, just merely a step on the way to destroying the sleepy, bloated market for business phone service. \"Conference calling was the low-hanging fruit, because it sucks. But as the next-gen provider of voice solutions, there's no limit unless the world runs out of phone numbers,\" says Walker, 49.\n\nThis month Walker introduced his company's big play, a service called Switch that replaces workers' desk phones and numbers with an app that works across whichever devices they want. If your boss calls your number, you can take it on your cellphone while walking from your car and then transfer it to your PC-connected headset at your desk. And when Switch connects to Google Apps it pulls in whatever data the apps have on the caller, such as emails, calendar meetings and shared files.\n\nThis was Walker's plan all along, and his investors Andreessen Horowitz and Google Ventures are betting he can carve out a big piece of the $75 billion spent each year on internet voice and unified communica- tions (many times bigger than the $4 billion conferencing market). Switch investor Marc Andreessen calls the company a two-stage rocket: \"The first stage gets it up in the air, and the second stage gets it in orbit.\" As fuel, Switch Communications raised $15 million in 2012, valuing it at an estimated $60 million before it saw a dime of revenue. It's likely worth four or five times that now.\n\nSwitch is at the forefront of a new crop of companies such as Grasshopper, RingCentral, Twilio and gUnify that are using the cloud to replace legacy telephone hardware, starting with \"private branch exchanges,\" or PBX systems, from Cisco and Avaya that o\u00ef\u00ac\u0083ces stick in a closet to route their calls. Switch charges about $15 per person per month, as much as 40 percent less than what IT managers have been paying for years, says telephony expert Phil Edholm. And by operating its servers out of data centres around the globe, Switch claims its call quality is just as good as the most expensive option.\n\n\"The world is changing and moving to the cloud,\" says Walker. \"There has to be a system and products around that new reality.\" Switch on its own is a disruptive force, but Walker has calculated he can gain a far wider market by working with his old colleagues at Google to make voice a significant feature in the latter's plans to take on Microsoft. Google's suite of business apps (Gmail, Drive, Hangouts, Docs) got o\u00ef\u00ac\u0080 to a slow start but is now a serious O\u00ef\u00ac\u0083ce rival, with over $1 billion in revenue, 5 million business customers and 5,000 more signing up every day.", "sim": 0.4862745106220245, "wgt": 2, "time": "05:21:00", "uri": "237931614", "url":

The goal of SmartenFit is to help users adopt a sustainable healthy lifestyle - beyond New Year's resolutions. The app is for those looking for a simplified way to monitor their nutritional choices and exercise, and set realistic and attainable goals without having to count every calorie or step. The tips and tools in SmartenFit are complementary to the book \"Smart People Don't Diet\" by Dr. Charlotte Markey, a health psychology professor at Rutgers University. The advice in the book and the SmartenFit app is based on decades of scientific evidence from psychologists, nutritionists, public health professionals, and doctors.\n\nPhoto - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20141230/166479\n\nThe SmartenFit app features:\n\nThe app is $2.99 and ad free. Future versions of the app may include a feature that allows users to submit a week of their food diary to a registered dietitian for review and feedback on their diet along with suggestions on how to improve their nutritional profile.\n\nSmartenFit was developed by three friends with PhD's and a common interest in health and wellness. Char, Lorie, and Jen met in their doctoral program at the University of California, Riverside in 1997 and have been friends ever since. Char became a world-renowned expert in health psychology and currently teaches at Rutgers University (www.CharlotteMarkey.com). Lorie became a data scientist and entrepreneur working in the domains of marketing research and education (http://coreducational.com/). Jen went on to become an expert in user experience and mobile innovation and has worked for several companies in Silicon Valley including Intuit, Microsoft, and America Online. As working mothers, they have all struggled to find easy ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Thus, the primary goal of SmartenFit is to provide a tool for regular people with busy lives that facilitates a path toward sustainable good health.\n\nAbout COREducational\n\nCOREducational is an educational consulting and app design development company.\n\nThis content was issued through the press release service at i-Newswire.com.

image.\n\nWe might begin with a singer oddly named Adele Dazeem, belting \"Let It Go\" from Disney's \"Frozen.\" Suddenly a friend would pour a bucket of ice water over her head. Adele would immediately tweet the moment on her new iPhone 6, hashtag #icebucketchallenge, while Ellen would pop out and take a group selfie that would #BreaktheInternet.\n\nNow let's get more serious. It's always a challenge to capture a year in pop culture, but we try nonetheless. Herewith, our annual, highly selective trip down memory lane:\n\nJanuary\n\nPharrell Williams has lots of reason to be happy this month. After a huge 2013, the producer-rapper-singer gets an Oscar nomination for \"Happy\" on the \"Despicable Me 2\" soundtrack. A week later, he wins four Grammys, including album and record of the year for producing the funk-electronic anthem \"Get Lucky.\" Happy, Lucky ... the guy certainly picks apt song titles.\n\nFebruary\n\nThe ground shifts in the late-night TV landscape: Jimmy Fallon takes over for Jay Leno and immediately establishes himself as the new king, with a younger, fresher vibe perfect for next-day YouTube viewing of bits like celebrity lip-syncing duels. Kicking off an eventful year in the tech world, Facebook pays a massive $19 billion for WHATSAPP, the popular mobile messaging service favored by teenagers and young adults - who see Facebook as something better suited to their parents. At New York Fashion Week, emerging star Lupita Nyong'o makes a front-row splash at Calvin Klein.\n\nMarch\n\nIt's Oscar time, and this year's show - the most-watched in a decade - gives us a slew of pop culture moments. Introducing Idina Menzel, John Travolta mangles her name in epic fashion, creating a new star: \"the one and only Adele Dazeem.\"\n\nEver the Broadway trouper, Menzel doesn't miss a beat as she sings the girl-power anthem \"Let It Go.\" Nyong'o completes her rapid ascent to superstardom with a supporting-actress trophy for \"12 Years a Slave,\" also the year's best picture. And speaking of superstars, Ellen DeGeneres takes that famous selfie with a gaggle of 'em, causing Twitter to crash for 20 minutes and beating the previous champion for retweets, a photo of Barack and Michelle Obama. Time for a new phrase in Hollywood-speak: \"Conscious uncoupling\" the term used by Gwyneth Paltrow to describe her enlightened split from Chris Martin.\n\nOh, and Obama pitches his health plan to young people via an unusual platform: Zach Galifianakis' comic Web series \"Between Two Ferns.\" Some conservative commentators call it undignified.\n\nApril\n\nYet more epic shifts in late-night: David Letterman announces he'll retire in 2015. His replacement is Comedy Central star Stephen Colbert, adored by the younger demographic. Letterman quips: \"I happen to know they wanted another guy with glasses.\" And now, we know you were getting antsy for Kimye news, so here it is: Kim Kardashian and soon-to-be hubby Kanye West make the prestigious cover of Vogue, sparking existential angst among some fashionistas. Kardashian tweets that it's \"a dream come true!!!\"\n\nMay\n\nBut the real dream comes when Kimye ties the knot at a Renaissance fortress in Florence, Italy, following lavish pre-wedding festivities in France. Angelina Jolie makes a splash as \"Maleficent,\" giving us a new take on the Disney character that's now more superheroine than villainess. Also making a splash: Laverne Cox, the openly transgender actress on \"Orange is the New Black,\" featured on the cover of Time magazine.\n\nJune\n\nLet's turn to sports: It's World Cup time, and who says America doesn't love soccer? People are glued to their TVs, iPads, phones and other devices for the U.S. games, and a hero is born: Tim Howard, the U.S. goalie, who even in a 2-1 defeat to Belgium makes a record-setting 16 saves. He becomes a social media darling - on Wikipedia, he briefly becomes the Secretary of Defense, edging out Chuck Hagel. And he inspires an Internet meme naming all the \"Things Tim Howard Could Save.\" (Example: The dinosaurs from extinction.)\n\nJuly\n\nA collective \"Awwwwww\" ricochets 'round the world as Britain's mediagenic royal couple, William and Kate, release photos of the equally mediagenic Prince George, upon his first birthday. Turns out his fashion choices - lots of blues, and bib overalls - prove as influential as his mom's. Cox, meanwhile, is nominated for an Emmy - the first nomination for an openly transgender person. It's also time for the campy \"Sharknado 2.\" A shark in the New York subway? No big deal. Manhattanites have seen rats that big.\n\nAugust\n\nWhoever would have thought a lowly bucket of ice would become a pop culture phenom? Celebs and regular folks alike take on the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, generating many millions of dollars to fight the disease. Epic screams are heard, but the most entertainingly blood-curdling comes from Oprah Winfrey. And what would August be without a wedding? Brangelina finally ties the knot, at a small ceremony on their French estate. A very sad note to the month: The death of Robin Williams, whose manic energy graced screens big and small, leaves a gaping hole in the cultural landscape.\n\nSeptember\n\nBack to weddings - and in this year of celebrity knot-tying, nothing is bigger than the lavish Venice festivities surrounding the nuptials of the bachelor who said he'd never marry again, George Clooney, and British human rights lawyer Amal?Alamuddin. Think traffic jams of paparazzi on gondolas. This isn't even the only Hollywood celebrity wedding in Italy this month - Neil Patrick Harris, next year's Oscar host, marries partner David Burtka. Big tech news: The new iPhone 6 arrives, with its larger screen and inevitable prestige factor. Apple also unveils its smartwatch, bringing the features of an iPhone to one's arm, and Microsoft spends $2.5 billion for the company that created the hit game \"Minecraft,\" popular on mobile phones. Sadly, the world loses deliciously tart-tongued Joan Rivers, a trailblazer for women in comedy.\n\nOctober\n\nMore life cycle events: Kate Middleton appears in public for the first time since announcing that she's expecting her second royal heir. As for Hollywood royalty, Jennifer Lawrence, about to make a splash with the latest \"Hunger Games\" installment, speaks out on the hacking scandal that led to nude photos of her - intended for her boyfriend - being published on websites. \"It is not a scandal. It is a sex crime,\" she says.\n\nNovember\n\nRemember when Ellen's selfie sorta broke the Internet? Well, Kim Kardashian (yes, her again), aiming to do the same, poses nude for Paper magazine, and the focus on her posterior leads to all sorts of talk about \"the year of the booty.\" Kudos to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which tweets a photo of a strikingly similar figure from one of its 4000 B.C. statues, noting that they can \"BreaktheInternet\" too.\n\nTaylor Swift, meanwhile, takes a stand, asking Spotify to stop streaming her music, and setting up an intriguing standoff between the industry's most popular artist and its top music streaming service. On a much more serious note, Bill Cosby, once America's most beloved TV dad, faces a cascade of allegations that he drugged and sexually assaulted women decades ago. The comedian's planned return to television is shelved, and his career suffers perhaps irreparable damage.\n\nDecember\n\nSuddenly it's the only thing anyone in Hollywood is talking about: The devastating Sony hacking scandal. After several weeks of embarrassing disclosures in hacked emails, the focus turns sharply in mid-December to genuine fear, as hackers threaten violence and mayhem at theaters showing \"The Interview,\" the Seth Rogen-James Franco film depicting the fictional assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Theater chains pull out, and Sony finally shelves the movie. The fallout is still developing, but it's clearly a sober ending to a dramatic year for the entertainment industry.", "sim": 0.3764705955982208, "wgt": 2, "time": "05:35:00", "uri": "237932757", "url": "http://www.altoonamirror.com/page/content.detail/id/601510.html", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "From ice buckets to breaking the Internet: A year in pop culture"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "16038", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"id": "16846", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "18090", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"id": "22611", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exploit (computer security)"}}, {"id": "29900", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenshot"}}, {"id": "40797", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software development kit"}}, {"id": "45302", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_leak", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet leak"}}, {"id": "46642", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denial-of-service attack"}}, {"id": "87250", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_group", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hacker group"}}, {"id": "196033", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homebrew (video games)"}}, {"id": "717886", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Powerstar Golf"}}, {"id": "718251", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 8"}}], "categories": [{"id": 14, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 44, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 495, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 543, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Sports", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 710, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Driving and Racing", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Driving_and_Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 876, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 906, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25484560", "source": {"id": "2226", "uri": "bgr.com", "title": "BGR"}, "eventUri": null, "isDuplicate": true, "body": "As if the massive DDoS attack from Lizard Squad wasn't enough of a disastrous end to the year for Sony and Microsoft, a new group called H4LT has apparently leaked the Xbox One software development kit on to Twitter.

advised enterprises that need large numbers of the old systems for existing applications to contact the company as soon as possible.\n\n\"We will do our best to fill your orders, but no more original sensors will be manufactured after the current stock sells out,\" the Kinect for Windows Team wrote in the post.\n\nThe phase-out of the original product doesn't come as a surprise, since Microsoft introduced the Kinect for Windows v2 and a second-generation software development kit, SDK 2.0, earlier this year.\n\nKinect for Windows brought motion-based interaction technology to PCs and tablets, offering new ways of controlling applications beyond the typical mouse and keyboard. Kinect senses depth using twin cameras and can interpret movements and gestures.\n\nKinect for Windows v2 adds full 1080p video, an expanded field of view and better body tracking, among other improvements, according to Microsoft.\n\nGamers were the first to use Kinect when it was introduced for the Xbox 360 console in 2010.

Worse, Apple is doing this to grab a few dollars a month from you to buy extra iCloud storage. Such a deal!\n\nNow let me put this in perspective, which is something most reports I've read about this lawsuit aren't doing.\n\nThe basic claim is that an 8GB and a 16GB iOS device doesn't have enough space because the OS is taking up too much of the precious available storage capacity. The lawsuit, filed on December 30 in a California federal court, claims that between 18.1% and 23.1% of the available storage on a 16GB iPod touch, iPad or iPhone are unavailable. Since you don't get the full 16GB, Apple is therefore misrepresenting the facts.\n\nNow before I go on, let's look at what these claims are alleging. Even if you lose a roughly 3.2GB of storage space for the OS and overhead, and decide that the 5GB free storage on iCloud isn't enough to compensate, you can get 20GB for 99 cents a month. So the conspiracy is that Apple is selling you gadgets costing hundreds of dollars, and offering insufficient storage to get you to shell out an additional $11.88 per year.\n\nWith me so far?\n\nWhat an incredible conspiracy to spark a class action lawsuit. Now of course the OS and overhead will consume some storage space. The question is whether iOS 8 is taking up too much for what it offers, and that seems silly on the face of it.\n\nRegardless of Apple's motives in making iOS 8 larger, and clearly it was to accommodate extra features and not to get you to pay $11.88 more per year, the lawsuit overlooks real examples of software bloat. Do you recall how a 32GB Microsoft Surface gave up nearly half that storage for overhead, the OS and apps? What about a certain Samsung Galaxy where 16GB available storage shrunk by similar percentages? Were there class action lawsuits against Microsoft and Samsung because they were engaged in a plot to sell you -- what? Microsoft is already offering a pretty decent deal on cloud storage, and Samsung really isn't heavily involved in that market.\n\nSo what's their endgame? To sell you gear with more storage capacity? But if you're dissatisfied with a Microsoft or Samsung gadget, for whatever reason, would they expect you to return it for a more expensive model? Does that really make sense to anyone?\n\nNow I suppose the legal eagles -- so to speak -- who initiated this class action lawsuit against Apple might have considered that the company really wanted you to buy iOS gear with more capacity, but expecting you to pay $100 extra is a stretch, so I suppose they figured manufacturing a $11.88 Storagegate conspiracy would seem more sensible. They are also using the iOS 8 prompt suggesting that you buy an iCloud subscription if you run out of storage as proof of the alleged conspiracy. But that hardly proves Apple deliberately made iOS 8 fatter. It strains logic, and one hopes the courts will see that too and dismiss this misbegotten, ambulance-chasing misfire before it gets too far along.\n\nBut it may also be that the court will want to establish a record about such cases, and allow it to run its course. That's very likely the reason the recently-concluded iPod conspiracy case was allowed to go to its logical conclusion. Once case law is established -- assuming it survives an appeal, if one is made -- lawyers who seek to file future actions can use the precedent.\n\nAnd remember that Apple won the iPod lawsuit, as the jury came back with the favorable verdict in a matter of three hours.\n\nNow what about those alleged aggrieved parties, the people who found their iPods, iPhones and iPads to be so bereft of space that they couldn't do what they wanted after upgrading to iOS 8? If Apple were to lose this case -- and I'm extremely doubtful that it has any chance of succeeding, or reaching a settlement -- what remedies can you expect?\n\nWhat about my wife's 16GB iPhone 5c? Well, it so happens she hasn't complained about the lack of available storage space, and it is running iOS 8.1.2.\n\nSo I suppose one solution would be for Apple to offer a one-year or two-year complimentary subscription to the 20GB iCloud storage plan. The losses would be minimal, and the key complaint, if had the remotest chance of being valid, would be dealt with. It's not as if Apple will give up and take back 16GB gear from aggrieved customers and give them models with larger capacity.\n\nOne thing is sure, though. As iOS takes more storage space, Apple should consider abandoning 16GB and moving right to 32GB. The actual cost increase to Apple would be minimal, barely impacting profits, and it would make customers with the cheapest devices happier and more apt to buy apps and music with which to fill their flash storage.\n\nIt would also discourage future legal teams from attempting stunts of this sort until, of course, a future iOS makes even 32GB seem paltry. I still wonder what might happen if the next Storagegate lawsuits impact the real offenders -- Microsoft and Samsung -- but that's not about to happen.", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "wgt": 3, "time":

author is a Forbes contributor. The opinions expressed are those of the writer.\n\nAccountability is a good thing. Here are my predictions for 2014 and how they played out. Last year I called for: 1) continued progress for the U.S. economy, 2) acceleration of healthcare reform, 3) beginning of similar reform in higher ed, 4) big data impacting many sectors, 5) tech/media/fashion converging, and 6) robotics becoming pervasive. Looking back, I would say that the economic forecast was right on; healthcare reform went slower than I expected because of the botched federal exchange roll-out; higher ed reform is accelerating; big data is having various impacts [but that was a softball prediction]; slow roll-out of smart watches is beginning a tech/media/fashon convergence; and robotics became pervasive in interesting ways.\n\nWe poll the NAV partners annually about the new, new things of the year past. My partners chose remarkably compelling flying drones such as the DJI Phantom II [a type of robot]; self-driving features in cars foreshadowing robotic cars; Uber becoming a juggernaut and a verb (e.g., \"we going to Uber-ize primary care\"); the first-generation smart watches; and the new crop of phablets (iPhone 6/+, Note 4), which take smart phones across a threshold, making them a truly useful connected computer in the pocket.\n\nData via eMarketer, 4/2014.\n\nWhat will be the key turning-points in 2015? Here are seven to watch for:\n\n1. Mobile computing will be the dominant platform, and desktop machines will become legacy technology. This is already true for the leaders, e.g., Facebook and Apple, with Google Google close behind. Mobile as a medium is already eclipsing many traditional media (see chart above). In 2015 phablets will make this a turning point. They make the mobile web truly usable by combining the web capabilities of a tablet with the connectivity and app capabilities of a smart phone, all in one pocket-able device. And phablets will quickly be ubiquitous.\n\n2. Consumers and businesses will choose their cloud partners. The cloud is an ecosystem with many interlinked parts, e.g., consumers use the cloud for back-up, file sharing, messaging, file and settings sync across devices, and audio and video conferencing. The cloud is built into mobile and desktop operating systems. The major vendors (Google, Microsoft Microsoft, Apple Apple) are building out complete cloud offerings. As they do so consumers will choose a primary vendor: interoperability benefits and pricing incentives will make this unavoidable. Businesses may stay longer with best-of-breed cloud services for different needs, but consolidation incentives will affect business too. So 2015 will be the year of the land-rush in the clouds [apologies for the mixed metaphor]. It's no surprise that you see an ad for IBM's cloud every time you turn around in an airport.\n\n3. Equity markets will level off, leaving investors hungry for alpha. Equities have had a great run since 2009, but equity valuations are now high by historical standards. The price war between the OPEC and Texas will halt earnings growth for energy companies, a key stock market sector. And investor enthusiasm will be dampened by risk factors that are building up globally: Ebola; civil wars in Syria, Iraq, and Ukraine; perpetual chaos in Afghanistan; muscle-flexing by increasingly-powerful China or increasingly-belligerent Russia; the Greek-fired return of Euro-jitters; and sumo wrestling between a Republican Congress and Democratic White House. Valuations for venture exits will level off too, as shown by the New Relic, HortonWorks, and ZenDesk IPOs, which occurred at or below the price of preceding private rounds. This will put the brakes on the late-stage and secondary gravy train in venture capital. Investors will need to reassess their venture capital allocations; hopefully some of them will find the longer-term play in early stage VC to be a good source of hard-to-find alpha.\n\n4. Robots will be accepted as part of life. Much of Christmas was picked and packed by Amazon's Kiva robots. Many cars will self-park or station-keep in traffic today, and perhaps you passed Google robotic car in California recently and did not even notice. Part of the movie you watched over Christmas may have been shot with a drone, and soon your roofer may use a drone to examine that chimney cap that keeps leaking.\n\nPage 1 / 2 Continue", "sim":

"isDuplicate": false, "body": "Changes in technology are happening at a scale that was unimaginable before and will cause disruption in industry after industry. This has really begun to worry me, because we are not ready for this change and most of our leading companies won't exist 15 to 20 years from now. Here are five sectors to keep an eye on:\n\nManufacturing\n\nRobotics and 3-D printing have made it cheaper to manufacture in the United States and Europe than in China. Robots such as Baxter, from Rethink Robotics, and UR10, from Universal Robots, have arms; screens that show you their emotions; and sensors that detect what is happening around them. The cost of operating them is less than the cost of human labor. We can now have robots working 24/7 and doing some of the work of humans. Over time, these robots will become ever more sophisticated and do most human jobs. The manufacturing industry is surely going to be disrupted in a very big way. This is good news for America, Europe and parts of Asia because it will become a local industry. But this will be bad for the Chinese economy, which is largely depends on manufacturing jobs.\n\nIn the next decade, robots will likely go on strike because we won't need them anymore. They will be replaced by 3-D printers. Within 15 to 20 years, we will even be able to 3-D print electronics. Imagine being able to design your own iPhone and print it at home. This is what will become possible.\n\nThe reinvention of finance\n\nWe are already witnessing a controversy over Bitcoin. Many technology and retail companies support it. Crowdfunding is shaking up the venture-capital industry and making it less relevant because it provides startups with an alternative for raising seed capital. We will soon be able to crowdfund loans for houses, cars and other goods. With cardless transactions for purchasing goods, we won't need the types of physical banks and financial institutions that we presently have. Banks in the United States seem to be complacent because laws protect them from competition, but our laws don't apply in other countries. We will see innovations happening abroad that disrupt U.S. industries.\n\nHealth care\n\nApple recently announced Healthkit, its platform for health information. It wants to store data from the wearable sensors that will soon be monitoring our blood pressure, blood oxygenation, heart rhythms, temperature, activity levels and other symptoms. Google, Microsoft and Samsung will surely not be left behind and will all compete to provide the best health-data platforms. With these data, they will be able to warn us when we are about to get sick. AI-based physicians will advise us on what we need to do to get healthy.\n\nMedical-test data, especially in fields such as oncology, is often so complex that human doctors cannot understand it. This will become even more difficult when they have genomics data to correlate. Over the past 15 years, the cost of human genome sequencing has dropped from the billions to about $1,000. At the rate at which prices are dropping, the cost of sequencing will be close to zero in a few years and we will all have our genomes sequenced. When you combine these data with the medical-sensor data that the tech companies are collecting on their cloud platforms, we will have a medical revolution. We won't need doctors for day-to-day medical advice any more. Robotic surgeons will also do the most sophisticated surgeries. We're going to disrupt the entire health care system.\n\nEnergy industry\n\nFive years ago, we were worried about America running out of oil; today we're talking about Saudi America - because of fracking. Yes, fracking is a harmful technology; nevertheless it has allowed America to become energy independent and will soon make it an energy exporter. And then there is solar energy, which some people have become negative about. But solar prices have dropped about 97 percent over the past 35 years, and, at the rate at which solar is advancing, by the end of this decade we will achieve grid parity across the United States. Grid parity means it's cheaper to produce energy at home on your solar cells than to buy it from utilities. Move forward another 10 or 20 years, and it will cost a fraction as much to produce your own energy as to buy it from the grid. This means that the utility companies will be in serious trouble. This is why they are beginning to fight the introduction of solar. If solar keeps advancing in this way, it will eclipse the fossil-fuel industry. Solar is only one of maybe 100 advancing technologies that could disrupt the energy industry.\n\nWhen we have unlimited energy, we can have unlimited clean water because we can simply boil as much ocean water as we want. We can afford to grow food locally in vertical farms. This can be 100 percent organic because we won't need insecticides in the sealed farm buildings.\n\nCommunications\n\nNote how AT&T, Verizon and Sprint have seen their landline businesses disappear. These were replaced by mobile - which is now being replaced by data. When I travel abroad, I don't make long-distance calls any more because I just call over Skype. Soon we will have Wi-Fi everywhere, thanks to the competition between companies such as AT&T and Google to provide superfast Internet access. We will be able to make free calls over open Wi-Fi networks.\n\nIn practically every industry that I look at, I see a major disruption happening. I know the world will be very different 15 to 20 years from now. The vast majority of companies that are presently the leaders in their industries will likely not even exist.

You may already be feeling a sense of dread over some of the New Year's resolutions you've told everyone you're going to make. Have you pledged to give up smoking? To lose weight at the gym? Off you pop then...\n\nWe're not saying you shouldn't make these type of resolutions, but it's probably raining outside, and your home is nice and warm. Do you really want to go outside? Here are some tech New Year's resolutions that are far more easy to keep, and can be completed from the comfort of your own, if you like, bed. While you're there, check out our collection of tutorialsto give you more than 2,800 reasons to stay put.\n\n1. 2015 tech resolutions: Back up your data\n\nConsider the amount of personal data stored on your PC, laptop, tablet or smartphone. You'll have photos, videos, music files, documents and more. Not only will some of these be irreplaceable, but it probably took you quite some time to gather them all together and make yourself at home on that computer. Now imagine someone steals your laptop, or your hard drive fails, or you accidentally overwrite those files. It happens every day, but you can quickly and easily set up an automated backup plan to protect your data. Follow our advice in our backup superguide to get started.\n\n2. 2015 tech resolutions: Don't be so easily fooled\n\nNo doubt you've read all our advice on securing your PC or laptop with good anti-malware, anti-spyware and a firewall (see Security Advisor), but there's one final piece of the security puzzle with which to contend: you. No offence intended, of course, but you are the weakest component in your computer's defences. It is you who chooses easy-to-guess passwords, clicks on links or opens attachments in emails without checking they are legit, falls victim to phishing attacks and leaves traces of your identity all over the web. The solution is simple, and good advice for all walks of life: think before you act. You can also read up on our security advice, starting with how to stop hackers stealing your data.\n\n3. 2015 tech resolutions: Manage your digital reputation\n\nIt's important to realise that these days your chances of securing that job of a lifetime depend on much more than your qualifications and CV. Your digital reputation is crucial. So, whether it's to support your career or simply to prevent your friends thinking you're an idiot and deleting you, watch what you post on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, particularly when you're somewhat worse for wear. Here are some tips on protecting your online reputation, too.\n\n4. 2015 tech resolutions: Make better use of your time\n\nTime is money, and we reckon we can help you make better use of it in 2015 and beyond. Whether you're sitting in front of a PC or on the move using a laptop, smartphone or tablet, you're bound to find some time savings among these gems. They may save only seconds, but add those up over a day, week or month and they start to become significant.\n\n5. 2015 tech resolutions: Spring clean in summer, autumn and winter\n\nOver time your PC will pick up all sorts of dust, grime and other yucky stuff, which is not only a bit gross, but it can cause the computer to overheat and slow down performance. Clean up your act! This one might involve you getting out of bed, but your efforts will be rewarded as your flagging PC is put back on track. Also see how to clean your laptop's cooling fans.\n\n6. 2015 tech resolutions: Upgrade to Windows 8.1\n\nOut with the old and in with the new. If you're still using Windows Vista or 7, for example, you're either very patient or you just don't know that life doesn't have to be like this. Windows 8.1 is Microsoft's flagship operating system, and you don't need to buy a new PC or laptop to enjoy it. Here's how to upgrade to Windows 8.1.\n\n7. 2015 tech resolutions: Rescue your analogue media\n\nAnalogue media, such as printed photos, slides and negatives won't last forever and, for each year that passes, you step that little bit closer to losing forever your precious memories. Follow our simple walkthroughs on digitising your photos and take action now.\n\nHow to scan or photograph old photos How to scan photographic negatives How to scan old colour slides Top tips on scanning old photos, negatives and slides\n\nAnalogue audio and video are subject to the same fate, so also check out our guides on converting audio tapes to CD or MP3 and VHS videos to DVD or Mpeg4.\n\n8. 2015 tech resolutions: Perfect your photos for free\n\nWe aren't all pro photographers, and you've probably got hundreds of digital photos that should have been worthy contenders for framing on the wall or sharing with friends and family but, ultimately, were a let-down. The perfect photographic moment may have passed, but it isn't too late to rescue your marred shots. You can correct blurred photos, remove red-eye, delete unwanted objects and more, all for free, with our useful tips. See our guide on fixing your photos for free.\n\n9. 2015 tech resolutions: Get fit with technology\n\nSmartwatches and fitness bands are the way forward in 2015. If you've made a resolution to lose some weight or just get in shape, check out ways technology can help you get fit. Also see our list of the best smartwatches 2015 and best fitness trackers 2015.\n\nThese are our top nine; add your own tech New Year's resolutions in the Comments field below.", "sim":

The reality is there is very little coding going on, and not many hackers are coders.\n\nThe \"Low Earth Ion Cannon\" (LOIC) is one such tool, not particularly sophisticated the \"LOIC\" causes a simulated browser to constantly refresh. On one system alone, the program is mostly useless, but when 10,000 or more systems combine to DDoS one site the results can be catastrophic. Most recently, bringing down Sony's and Microsoft's live gaming services. Still, a far cry from what we imagine the first time we heard \"shall we play a game\".\n\nThere is another less discussed, yet growing form of \"hacking\". Parental monitoring software with enough features to make the NSA jealous. These applications are no doubt intrusive, invading chats, keylogging and sometimes even \"listening in\". Are parents justified in the use of these applications? One can't help but think of recent suicides due to online bullying, while attempted suicides are not reported; here are the facts. Almost 10% of teenagers have seriously considered attempting suicide, and 25% have experienced some form of online bullying. That does not include the 20% who have used some form of drugs prior to the age of 18, or the unknown number of those that have been sexually solicited online. Are parents who are discreetly monitoring their children's online activity hackers?\n\nEmployers are increasingly monitoring their employees as well. While live GPS tracking may not be considered \"intrusive\" for a worker making deliveries, most cell phone monitors track much more. Chats, texts, phone calls and even photos and videos can all be sent to the employer in real-time.\n\nThese questions about ethical hacking fall into a grey area that make right and wrong fall under a blurry veil. Most would argue that there is no right and wrong when it comes to keeping our children safe and free from sexual predators, but where do you draw the line on employees, on suspicious spouses, or on your own electronic devices that are in the possession of other people.\n\nCurrent versions of parental monitoring software are invisible, install remotely and report back without the child ever knowing they are being monitored. Some allow the parent to even log into the child's phone and listen to its surroundings, and others allow the parent to see right through the devices built-in camera. Can this be considered \"hacking\" for a good cause? Could recent teen suicides have been prevented by parental \"hacking\", and is it justified.\n\nWhen multinational corporations who spend millions on a secure infrastructure cannot expect privacy - who can. Parents who invade their children's privacy in a bid for safety are facing the same difficult choices as is the NSA. Ultimately the people will decide where the line is to be drawn; voluntarily through their votes, or in-voluntarily through the court system. The questions about privacy vs. security will be answered.\n\nAbout RemoteKeyloggers.net:\n\nRemote Keyloggers provides parental monitoring software to parents concerned with the online safety of their children.

However, Google has been seen to challenge the video conferencing app with its Hangouts, a new platform that's considered groundbreaking in technology when it comes to free video chatting. The two apps continue to battle it out in the world of video chatting, with each striving to win bigger share of the ever-growing market. Let's compare Skype vs Hangouts, looking at their features, what they have in similar and their differences.\n\nLandline and mobile calling\n\nIf you want to make free calls you can do so with Skype but you need to subscribe first and your calls have to be to another Skype user. People in Canada and the U.S. need to pay a subscription fee of $2.99 on monthly basis if they want to enjoy the calls. For domestic pay as you go, you will expect to spend about 2.3 cents in every minute.\n\nFor those using Google Hangouts and have a Google Voice number, they will be able to make and receive calls for absolutely free. Whether you are anywhere in Canada or the U.S, you will be able to call your friends and family without paying a cent.\n\nInternational calling\n\nSkype users who want to make calls anywhere in the world will be able to do so for free provided the user on the other end is using Skype too. However, for mobile and landline calls one will be expected to dig deeper in their pockets for $13.99 every month, excluding rural Colombian areas. Microsoft also offer another package called Unlimited World Plan, which allows you to make unlimited calls to mobiles and landlines.\n\nAs for Hangouts, everything is different with the costs of international calling. You will be able to make international calls for absolutely free, provided the receiver is also using hangouts. For international calls to mobile and landlines you will be expected to pay a few cents depending on the region you wish to call.\n\nMobile Device Access\n\nNearly every mobile device supports Skype app, but requires data access through 3G, 4G or Wi-Fi. Your smartphone will basically use Wi-Fi connection when operating the app, and when cellular data isn't available, then it will use data plan that you have subscribed to.\n\nSimilarly for Hangouts, it supports all mobile devices and also operates in 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi connections. It will also use your data plan suppose your cellular data isn't available. A good thing to note however is that, Hangouts app does not work for Android devices using AT&T's network. In such a case Wi-Fi connection has to be used.\n\nFile and Screen Sharing\n\nSkype basically allows you to share your files over audio/video calls as well as IM. Since Hangouts have been integrated with Google Drive, document sharing will be much easier, with the new Google + going a step further to enable photo sharing.\n\nWhen it comes to screen sharing, Skype offers you an opportunity to share your screen but the feature is limited. You have to establish a video call before going ahead to share. Hangouts allow you to create a chat room and test or prepare the screen before you proceed to invite participants to join in for video chatting.\n\nVerdict\n\nOne thing that these two video-conferencing apps have to be given credit for, is that they are easy to use and work perfectly when making calls and chatting. However, if you want to enjoy more free services Google is the app to go for, whereas those who wish to enjoy more features at a cost can opt for Skype.", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "wgt": 2, "time": "09:27:00", "uri": "237951681", "url": "http://thefusejoplin.com/2014/12/skype-hangouts-video-conferencing/", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Skype Vs Hangouts - Best Of Video Conferencing"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "16029", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email address"}}, {"id": "16038", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"id": "16308", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer network"}}, {"id": "16454", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"id": "16677", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17433", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"id": "17484", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"id": "18090", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"id": "27711", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"id": "30092", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_controller", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game controller"}}, {"id": "40367", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_(computing)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mouse (computing)"}}, {"id": "40797", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software development kit"}}, {"id": "256923", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kinect"}}, {"id": "262075", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"id": "801991", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_hardware", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox 360 hardware"}}], "categories": [{"id": 44, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 70, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 486, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 915, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25489847", "source": {"id": "4781", "uri": "www.pcadvisor.co.uk", "title": "PC Advisor"}, "eventUri": "eng-1243604", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Now that the Kinect for Windows v2 is out, Microsoft will be selling out its stock of the first-generation motion-based controller\n\nMicrosoft will stop selling the original Kinect for Windows in 2015 now that the second generation of the motion-based controller platform is available.\n\nIn a blog post, Microsoft advised enterprises that need large numbers of the old systems for existing applications to contact the company as soon as possible.\n\n\"We will do our best to fill your orders, but no more original sensors will be manufactured after the current stock sells out,\" the Kinect for Windows Team wrote in the post.\n\nThe phase-out of the original product doesn't come as a surprise, since Microsoft introduced the Kinect for Windows v2 and a second-generation software development kit, SDK 2.0, earlier this year.\n\nKinect for Windows brought motion-based interaction technology to PCs and tablets, offering new ways of controlling applications beyond the typical mouse and keyboard.

suffered, fought and rejoiced during 2014 as some of their projects failed, while others moved forward.\n\nOne of the most significant failures was linked to the Oct. 28 explosion of an Orbital Sciences rocket, which was to have carried two Washington-based outer space projects to the International Space Station.\n\nThe fiery explosion off the coast of Virginia just seconds after liftoff, took with it Redmond-based Planetary Resources' first satellite, as well as a group of other satellites brokered by Seattle-based Space Launch Services. No people were injured in the blast.\n\nThe setback was especially marked for Planetary Resources - the asteroid mining company founded by former Microsoft executive Charles Simonyi and other investors - because the satellite was to test critical parts of the company's systems.\n\nThe loss of the Akyrd 3 would not affect the company's development schedule, a Planetary Resources representative said shortly after the accident.\n\nSpace Launch Services, which brokers space on other company's launch vehicles, escaped essentially unscathed because the launch failure was not the company's fault.\n\nAnother explosion just three days later also reshuffled the cards for a Washington state space entrepreneur. This time it was Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.\n\nOn Oct. 31 competitor Richard Branson's SpaceShip Two exploded at 45,000 feet, killing the test pilot and seriously delaying Branson's plans to take tourists to outer space.\n\nThe disaster may have chilled the market for Bezos' vision of flying people into outer space aboard the New Shepard space vehicle his secretive company, Blue Origin, has been developing in Kent.\n\nSteve Wilhelm covers manufacturing, aerospace and trade for the Puget Sound Business Journal.", "sim": 0.4274509847164154, "wgt": 2, "time": "10:11:00", "uri": "237955575", "url": "http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2014/12/31/rockets-blew-up-blue-origin-got-real-seattles-year.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%253A%2Bvertical_65%2B%2528Travel%2BService%2BIndustry%2BNews%2529", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Rockets blew up, Blue Origin got real \u2013 Seattle's year in space - Puget Sound Business Journal"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "15599", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17242", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"id": "17433", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"id": "24321", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"id": "24999", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"id": "27711", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"id": "40797", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software development kit"}}, {"id": "110968", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field of view"}}, {"id": "256923", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kinect"}}, {"id": "717886", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerstar Golf"}}], "categories": [{"id": 70, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 91, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 92, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 94, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 95, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 547, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 644, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Games", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25508302", "source": {"id": "2926", "uri": "www.destructoid.com", "title": "Destructoid"}, "eventUri": "eng-1243604", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Microsoft has announced that they will be ending sales for the original Kinect for Windows sensor in 2015.

the country's mobile handset and component manufacturing eco-system.\n\n\"The task force will be meeting the Department of Electronics and Information Technology secretary (R.S.Sharma) in the first week of January,\" Pankaj Mohindroo, national president, Indian Cellular Association, told IANS. Sharma is also the chairman of the task force.\n\n\"(One of the tasks is) To promote large-scale manufacturing/assembling activity to achieve production of 500 million units by 2019. This can create additional employment opportunities for 1.5 million approximately,\" a note issued by the department said.\n\nIt also laid thrust on increasing exports from the estimated 30 million units in 2014 to 120 million units by 2019.\n\nIndia's position in mobile phone exports has fallen from seventh in 2009 to 14th in 2013. The value of exports was $3.40 billion in 2009 and fell to $2.28 billion in 2013.\n\nIndustry stakeholders say at this rate, handset exports will crash to zero in 2015.\n\n\"Through this task force we will be reaching out to global handset manufacturers, brands, ODMs (original design manufacturers) and EMS (electronic manufacturing services) to request them to come and set up shop in India. The government has to provide a level playing fields to those players,\" Mohindroo said.\n\nHe said sub-committees will be formed under this group to carry out various tasks, adding that promoting manufacturing will also have a positive impact on the prices of mobile handsets and they will come down.\n\nIn India, Samsung and Micromax currently engage in the large-scale manufacturing of handsets. Nokia operated the world's largest manufacturing facility at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu which was shut down in November on tax and labour issues.\n\nAll the other players import their products mostly from China, followed by Vietnam.\n\nThe estimated domestic mobile handset market size is Rs.75,000 crore ($12 billion) in 2014, of which handsets worth Rs.58,550 crore are imported.\n\nFor 2015, the estimated market size is Rs.1 lakh crore, with imports accounting for Rs.75,500 crore.\n\nThe task force has to create a roadmap to align technology, demand, standards and regulations for enhancing the competitiveness of domestic manufacturing across the supply chain for manufacturing mobile phone.\n\n\"(One of the tasks is) To promote research and development for mobile phone products and services for meeting the infrastructure needs of domestic and global market,\" the government note said.\n\nThe task force has members like Josh Foulger, president and director, India Operations Programme and president, Nokia Special Economic Zone, Hari Om Hari; Lava co-founder Kenichiro Hibi; managing director, Sony India, Sandeep Bhargava; director, government relations, Microsoft Devices India, Soon H Kwon; and co-founder, Micromax Informatics, Vikas Jain, among others as its members.\n\nThe other members are S.P.

The film also generated about $2.8 million in a limited number of movie theaters, where it debuted a day after its online release.\n\nThose numbers could be the proof the industry needs to release more blockbusters online -- giving movie-goers more choice, said technology analyst Roger Kay.\n\n\"The floodgates are now open for digital distribution,\" said Kay, founder of Endpoint Technologies Associates. \"Yes, these were special circumstances, but they allowed the world to see that there's no reason not to stream on day one. I think it will change movie distribution forever.\"\n\nThe film's box office take was still a fraction of the $100 million in revenue projected before major theater chains refused to screen the film following vague threats of terrorism because the movie depicted a plot to assassinate North Korea leader Kim Jong Un. The film led to a cyberattack against Sony Pictures that the FBI blamed on North Korea.\n\nWhen big theater chains bailed out, the Culver City (Los Angeles County) movie studio owned by Japan's Sony, said it would cancel the planned Christmas Day release. It then backtracked and cobbled together 331 independently owned theaters that started screening the film on Dec. 25.\n\nSony managed to quickly cut deals to distribute the movie online starting on Christmas Eve in North America through Google Play, YouTube, Microsoft's Xbox Video and a special website, seetheinterview.com. Sony charged viewers $5.99 to rent or $14.99 to buy. It arrived on Apple's iTunes four days later.\n\nThe online totals instantly made \"The Interview\" Sony's most successful digital movie and the top-selling film this year on Google Play, although those were low barriers to hurdle. At least 2.5 million additional viewers managed to see the film without paying, due to link-sharing and pirated versions, according to the BitTorrent news site TorrentFreak.com.\n\nStill, the combined $18 million box office take nearly equaled the $20.3 million theatrical opening weekend for the Rogen-directed 2013 movie \"This Is the End.\"\n\nMore importantly, \"The Interview\" gave Sony an inadvertent opportunity to test partnerships with tech companies that would be more than eager to deliver additional movies online in the future -- Google, Microsoft and Apple.\n\nFor a century, theaters have held a tight grip on the exclusive first-run window of a movie's distribution cycle. That grip is loosening, with some online release dates inching closer to theatrical debuts. But so far, with the exception of a handful of smaller-budget independent studio films, movies aren't typically available for home video for at least 90 days after their theatrical debut.\n\n'Proof of concept'\n\n\"The Interview\" became the \"proof of concept\" for what the movie industry calls a \"day-and-date\" release strategy -- making a new film available for home video on the same date that it's released in theaters, Kay said.\n\n\"That stranglehold just got broken,\" Kay said. Sony's online deals give it and other studios more leverage to say, \"We don't even need the theaters, we can go direct to consumers.\"\n\nMovie-goers who are weary of springing $12 for the cost of one theater ticket, not including high-priced candy, popcorn and soda, might prefer a $6 fee to watch from the comfort of their own homes.\n\nTheaters have long touted the experience of big high-resolution screens. But Kay said that could change because the newer Ultra High Definition TV monitors now on sale can equal, or sometimes surpass, the screen resolutions offered by theaters.\n\nBut not everyone is convinced \"The Interview\" is a game-changer.\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with the movie and TV industry measurement service Rentrak, agreed that \"The Interview's\" online performance has ignited a \"valid point of discussion\" of cinema's digital future.\n\nHowever, he said the circumstances behind \"The Interview\" make it an anomaly.\n\n\"It's easy to say there's going to be a paradigm shift,\" Dergarabedian said. \"It certainly wouldn't happen overnight. The financials and economics of it don't add up right now.\"\n\nFor example, the industry's current blockbuster, \"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,\" has grossed about $600 million in its theaters-only release worldwide. Box office performances like that also boost future home video sales.\n\nSo the movie industry isn't going to jeopardize those kinds of revenues by taking next year's anticipated big hits, including the new \"Star Wars\" and \"Jurassic Park\" sequels and the movie version of \"Fifty Shades of Grey,\" online.\n\nNot worried\n\nHe also said movie theaters have more than survived incursions from new technologies, including radio and television.\n\n\"Online is not going to kill the movie star,\" Dergarabedian said.\n\nHowever, he said \"The Interview\" experience might lead the industry to try more day-and-date releases of smaller independent films, where the objective is not so much to make gobs of money, but to reach larger audiences.\n\n\"The best thing to come out of this is the realization that smaller movies can have a tremendous benefit from day-and-date release,\" he said. \"In the virtual world, you can go nationwide, even worldwide, with your release in an instant.\"\n\nAnalyst Joel Espelien of the Diffusion Group said Sony fumbled its chance to make a bigger digital splash by not making it initially available to traditional pay TV companies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sony did just that by making the film available for video-on-demand platforms from a list of providers that included Comcast, Time Warner Cable, AT&T, Verizon and DirecTV. The film also opened in about 200 additional independent theaters.\n\nIn a blog post, Espelien said Sony should have cast an even wider net.\n\n\"Sony's best move might have been to sell the rights to one of the Big 4 broadcasters (ABC, NBC, CBS or Fox) for an immediate free-with-ads showing. This would have been seen as a patriotic move and probably would have generated big ratings,\" he said.\n\nStill, the industry has learned a lot from \"The Interview.\"\n\n\"Love it or hate it, 'The Interview' demonstrates just how far and how fast things are changing in the video entertainment business,\" he said. \"The old, unwritten rules that have governed Hollywood for decades are crumbling, and the new ones haven't been figured out yet. Maybe it's best for all that we have flash-in-a-pan movies like 'The Interview' to use as guinea pigs and learning exercises.\"", "sim": 0.6392157077789307, "wgt": 2, "time": "10:39:00", "uri":

cyber-fraud offences in 2013-14 has been linked to the Lizard Squad hacking group thought to be behind the attacks on Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live gaming services over Christmas.\n\nThe unnamed man from Twickenham was arrested in a raid on his home by the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (SEROCU) before being released on bail.\n\n\"The arrest is in connection with an ongoing investigation into cyber-fraud offences which took place between 2013 and August 2014 during which victims reported funds being stolen from their PayPal accounts,\" Thames Valley police said in a statement on behalf of SEROCU.\n\nIndependent security researcher Brian Krebs claimed the arrested man was Vinnie Omari, posting what appeared to be a copy of Omari's bail notice after having alleged that the 22-year-old was part of the Lizard Squad hacking group.\n\n\"Sources tell KrebsOnSecurity that Vinnie is one of many individuals associated with this sad little club who are being rounded up and questioned,\" said Krebs in a blog post.\n\n\"They took everything, Xbox One, phones, laptops, computer USBs, etc,\" Omari allegedly told the Daily Dot in an email revealing the search warrant issued by Reading magistrates court but failing to elaborate on the charges and alleged crimes in 2013.\n\nThe Lizard Squad, described as \"a band of young hooligans\" by Krebs, has been linked with a series of high-profile distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks prevent legitimate users of services such as Sony's PlayStation Network from connecting to them by bombarding them with bogus connections, overloading the service and effectively taking it offline often until the attack ceases.\n\nThe group recently launched a DDoS tool that could allow anyone to conduct similar attacks on targets of their choosing, costing between $6 (\u00a33.85)

"isDuplicate": false, "body": "What happened in 2014? One thing I did not predict is that Samsung lost its momentum. Here are Gartner's figures for global smartphone sales by vendor, for the third quarter of 2014:\n\nSamsung is still huge, of course. But in 2013, Samsung seemed to be in such control of its premium brand that it could shape Android as it wished, rather than being merely an OEM for Google's operating system. In the enterprise, Samsung KNOX held promise as a way to bring security and manageability to Android, but only in Samsung's flavour. Today, that seems less likely. Market share is declining, and much of KNOX has been rolled into Android Lollipop. What is going wrong? The difficulty for Samsung is how to differentiate its products sufficiently, to avoid bleeding market share to keenly priced competition from vendors such as Xiaomi and Huawei. This is difficult if you do not control the operating system.\n\nWhat of the overall mobile OS wars? 2013 brought few surprises: the Apple/Android duopoly continued, Blackberry further diminished its share, and Windows Phone struggles on, though it was not looking good for Microsoft's OS as 2013 closed; the Nokia acquisition may have been fumbled.\n\nThat brings me to Microsoft, a company I watch closely. 2014 saw Satya Nadella appointed as CEO and several strategic changes, though the extent to which Nadella introduced those changes is uncertain. What changes?\n\nOffice is going truly cross-platform, with first-class support for iOS and Android. I covered this recently on the Register; the summary is that there will be mobile versions of Office for iOS, Android and Windows (this last a Store app) with similar features, and that more and more of the functionality of desktop Office will turn up in the mobile versions. I learned from my interview with Technical Product Manager Kaberi Chowdhury that ODF (Open Document) support is planned, as is some level of programmability.\n\nThe plans for Office are a clue to the company's wider strategy, which is focused on cloud and server. Key products include Office 365, Windows Azure, Active Directory (and Azure Active Directory), SQL Server, SharePoint, and System Center as a management tool for hybrid cloud.\n\nThe Windows client strategy is to bring back users who disliked Windows 8 with a renewed focus on the desktop in the forthcoming Windows 10, while retaining the Store app model for apps that are secure, touch-friendly, and easily deployed. It is still not clear what Windows 10 phones and tablets will look like, but we can expect convergence; no more Windows RT, but perhaps tablets running Windows Phone OS that are in effect the next generation of Windows RT without a desktop personality.\n\nThe company will also hedge its bets with full app support for Office and its cloud services on iOS and Android, and in doing so will make its Windows mobile offerings less compelling.\n\nMicrosoft's developer tools are changing in line with this strategy. The next generation of .NET is open source and cross-platform on the server side, for Windows, Mac and Linux. Xamarin plugs the gap for .NET on iOS and Android, while Microsoft is also adding native support (not .NET based) for cross-platform mobile in the next Visual Studio.\n\nThese are big changes to the developer stack, and Microsoft is forking .NET between the continuing Windows-only .NET Framework, and the new cross-platform .NET Core. Developers have many questions about this; see this interview on the Register for what I could glean about the current plans. Watch our for the Build conference at the end of April when the company will attempt to put it all together into a coherent whole for developers targeting either Windows 10, or cloud apps, or cloud services with cross-platform mobile clients.\n\nThis entire strategy is a logical progression from the company's failure in mobile. Can it now succeed with client apps running on platforms controlled by its competitors? Alternatively, is there hope that Windows 10 can keep businesses hooked on Windows clients? Maybe 2015 will bring some answers, though with Windows 10 not expected until towards the end of the year there will be a long wait while iOS, Android and even Chrome OS (the operating system of Chromebook) continue to build.\n\nThe puzzle with Microsoft is that there is still too much mediocrity and complacency that damages the company's offerings. How can it expect to succeed in the crowded wearable market with a band that is uncomfortable to wear? There is still an attitude in some parts of the company that the world will be happy to put up with problems that might be fixed in a future version after some long interval. Then again, the Azure team is doing great things and Windows server continues to impress. Win or lose, there will be plenty of Microsoft news this year.\n\nLate last year I attended Amazon's re:Invent conference in Las Vegas; I wrote this up here. The key announcement for me was Amazon Aurora, a MySQL clone, not so much because of its merits as a cloud database server, but more because it represents a new breed of applications that are designed for the cloud. If you design database storage with the knowledge that it will only ever run on a huge cloud-scale infrastructure, you can make optimizations that cannot be replicated on smaller systems. I tried to summarize what this means in another Register piece here. The fact that this type of technology can be rented by any of us at commodity prices increases the advantage of public cloud, despite reservations that many still have concerning security and control. It also poses a challenge for companies like Oracle and Microsoft whose technology is designed for on-premises as well as cloud deployment; they cannot achieve the same advantage unless they fork their products, creating cloud variants that use different architecture.\n\nHere is what I wrote a year or so ago, Reflecting on 2013- the year of not the PC, no privacy, and the Internet of Things. Most of it still applies. I have not achieved any of the three goals I set for myself though. Maybe this year...", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "wgt": 3, "time": "11:47:00", "uri": "237964656", "url":

But 2015 could be the year the technology finally goes mainstream, starting with the launch of the highly anticipated Oculus Rift or a model derived from it.\n\nThe idea behind these devices is that users can fully immerse themselves in a 360\u00c2\u00b0 virtual world, whether to escape into the fantasy setting of a video game or to experience a new perspective on a documentary film, for example.\n\nCurrently, the company most aggressively pursuing the technology is Oculus VR, which was acquired by Facebook in 2014. Since 2012, Oculus VR has developed several prototypes, including the latest and most advanced model, the Crescent Bay, unveiled in September. Now, ahead of the release of the company's first production model in 2015, there is even talk of launching a dedicated apps platform.\n\nThe Oculus Crescent Bay, which is described as a more advanced version of the earlier Rift and Crystal Cove prototypes, features an improved design and -- for the first time -- built-in audio headphones. The manufacturer has also mentioned higher screen resolution and a faster refresh rate, although no exact figures were announced.\n\nWhile Oculus VR has not yet released a headset under its own name, the company lent some of its expertise to Samsung during the development of the Gear VR, which was presented at IFA 2014. On sale for $199.99 (so far only in the US), the headset is only compatible with the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 for the time being.\n\nOther manufacturers are making similar forays into the VR headset market. The French brand Archos, for example, markets its VR Glasses, which are compatible with any Android, iOS or Windows Phone smartphone of up to six inches and cost just $29.99.\n\nIt's safe to say there will be at least a few VR headsets announced at the coming edition of CES, which takes place in Las Vegas from January 6 to 9. Sony and Microsoft, for example, might enter the emerging market as early as 2015 by introducing VR headsets for their respective games consoles.", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "wgt": 2, "time":

"PCWorld"}, "eventUri": "eng-1245451", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Welcome to 2015: A brand new year and a great time for a fresh start. Instead of shooting for nebulous, unrealistic goals in the New Year, start off 2015 with vows to improve your digital life. (You weren't really going to go to the gym every day or be nicer to your siblings anyway.)\n\nMost of the suggestions below aren't hard to achieve and some are even the set-it-and-forget-it kinds of resolutions. But you, your PC, and your data will be much better off once you've hit these technological high points.\n\nConventional wisdom says you should have three copies of your data: the \"original\" on your PC, a backup at home, and a backup off-site.\n\nYou should already be backing up your PCs at home with an external hard drive, but what about the third backup? It's better to be safe than sorry if the worst befalls your home, like a robbery or fire.\n\nThe easiest way to get an off-site backup is to use online backup services like Backblaze, Carbonite, or CrashPlan. We're not talking about syncing-focused cloud storage solutions like Dropbox or OneDrive here. Pure online backup services generally don't offer sync (SpiderOak excluded) and are usually much cheaper than their cloud storage counterparts. Backblaze, the service I currently use, charges you $50 a year to back up one PC plus any connected drives.\n\nThat's small price to pay for peace of mind about your family photos, music, videos, and documents. Consider choosing a service that gives you the option to encrypt your data without providing the service itself a copy of the key (your encryption password). It does take a little more responsibility, because if you forget your password you'll need to upload your data to the cloud all over again -- the backup service won't be able to descramble everything for you. But in this age of governmental snooping, it's better to keep your personal data as protected as possible.\n\nIn late August, highly personal photos of celebrities such as Jennifer Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst surfaced online after falling into the hands of hackers who'd pilfered them from services such as iCloud. The hack was yet another reminder that you need to be careful about what you put online.\n\nNo, it's not fair to blame the victim in cases like these, but devastating hacks of personal data aren't going away anytime soon. So the best way to avoid any serious damage is to avoid putting anything online that you might regret being seen by others.\n\nDon't forget that any photos you take with your phone may automatically be backed up to a cloud storage service depending on how you've configured your settings -- that how the actresses' compromising pictures wound up on the Internet in the first place. The epic Sony Pictures hack can teach us a lot about protecting our email, including what not to say in digital messages. Finally, be sure to perform these five privacy fixes on Facebook pronto.\n\nI know, I know, XP works just fine so why bother upgrading to a new OS? Here's the thing: XP is over. If any serious vulnerabilities show up, you'll be on your own.\n\nAnd wouldn't you like to keep up with some of the latest software? Only some of the most widespread programs, like Chrome, are going to continue supporting XP, and even Chrome's not promising support past April. It's been more than 12 years since XP landed on store shelves, and nearly half a decade since you've been able to buy a new XP PC. It's time to move on -- or at least time to batten down the XP security hatches if you refuse to budge.\n\nThat said, unless you installed XP on some fairly recent hardware or don't mind giving Linux a try, you'll probably need a new PC in order to upgrade to a modern operating system. In that case, you should probably wait for the first wave of Windows 10 PCs to come out later in 2015. Windows 10 is an upcoming version of Windows that offers more traditional desktop PC behavior (such as the Start menu) than Windows 8, whose radical redesign alienated longtime Microsoft faithfuls.\n\nIt's rumored that Windows 8 users will be able to upgrade to Windows 10 for free, but that hasn't been confirmed yet. You wouldn't want to buy a new Windows 8 PC only to have it be made obsolete by a far superior version of Windows months later. In the meantime, you can give the Windows 10 Technical Preview a whirl.\n\nIf you've been holding out, 2015 is the year you should finally buy a solid-state drive.\n\nSSD prices have plummeted, with 250GB drives available for less than $100. That's still not as quite as cheap on a price-per-GB basis as (far slower) traditional hard drives, but nevertheless finally in the affordable range. There were also some nice innovations added to SSDs in 2014, including M.2 PCIe SSDs and Samsung's speed- and endurance-boosting 3D V-Nand technology. And if you're concerned about the longevity of SSDs, a recent study showed that such worries are utterly unfounded.\n\nYou really owe it to yourself (and your PC) to speed it up by swapping out that old spinning hard drive for a far speedier SSD. There is no greater upgrade you can perform. An SSD can make even the pokiest old PC feel like greased lightning.\n\n2015 is the year to give Chromebooks another chance.\n\nIn 2014, we saw a slew of strong Chromebooks come out with decent specs and prices hovering between $250 and $400. Beyond the hardware itself, Chromebooks' offline capabilities got a nice boost with the addition of Google Play Movies and TV, and Chromebooks got the ability to run some Android apps. Photoshop, Office, and Skype all embraced the Web (and thus Google's laptops) in 2014. Those growing capabilities helped Chromebooks become more popular in the workplace and in schools. In July Dell was forced to halt Chromebook sales after an unexpected demand for the Googley laptops.\n\nYes, 2014 is truly the year Chromebooks hit their stride.\n\nI know, I know, security again, but there were numerous devastating data breaches in 2014, including attacks on eBay, Home Depot, JP Morgan Chase, and Sony Pictures. There's not a lot you can do to protect your username and password from getting pilfered on company servers. But you can make it as hard as possible to make that information useful.\n\nPasswords are often scrambled using a technique called hashing that requires hackers to unscramble them (if possible) for the logins to be of any use. Using a password of common words makes it easier for the unscrambling to happen.\n\nBut a relatively long password (say 10-12 characters) of random letters, numbers, and special symbols (if allowed) can go a long way toward preventing discovery. Also make sure you use a unique password on every important site you use, such as banking, email, and social networking accounts.\n\nNow that you're creating hard-to-remember passwords, you're going to need a tool that can remember them for you. Try using a password manager like Dashlane or LastPass. Both come with automatic password-changing features that can swap out all your passwords for new, randomized ones in a matter of minutes.\n\nSeriously: Password managers are great. Use one.\n\nOnce you've got your passwords sorted out, enable two-factor authentication everywhere you can. If hackers do manage to figure out your password, two-factor authentication will put another stumbling block in their way.\n\nBefore you throw out that old PC after the holidays, consider whether it has a new career opportunity, perhaps as an entertainment PC or a child's computer. You can also breathe new life into an old PC with a few cheap, simple tweaks. (Yes, upgrading to an SSD is one of the suggestions.)\n\nBut if your PC has met its doom, make sure you dispose of it responsibly. Take it to a tech recycling depot or drop-off point. There are many available at places like Apple Stores and Best Buy.\n\nIn recent years, the tech world has exploded with all kinds of new things to try. Why not start 2015 by reinvigorating your thirst for technology with a fresh project?\n\nIf you like gaming, 2015 is expected to be the year virtual reality debuts in a big way, with the consumer release of the Oculus Rift VR headset, priced somewhere between $200 and $400. There's also Valve's incoming SteamOS for those looking to drag PC gaming into their living room, as well as Steam's killer new game-streaming feature. Or you can try running your own Minecraft server for some family fun.\n\nIf you'd like to try something a little more advanced, 3D printing is getting bigger (and easier) every year, or you can give programming and hardware hacking a shot with the itty-bitty Raspberry Pi. There are two recently refreshed models to check out, including the $35 Raspberry Pi model B+ and the $25 A+. For some serious hardware hacking why not build your own PC? If it's your first, we've got some tips for avoiding common PC building mistakes.\n\nAnd if you've never bothered with basic maintenance tasks, now's the time to start -- it'll help your PC stay clean and run like a champ.

This time though,, it isn't a case of services being taken away from users -- instead, the software development kit for the Xbox One is being freely circulated online.\n\nIn fact, the group -- known as 'H4LT' -- were quick to distance themselves from the perpetrators of the recent Xbox Live and PSN outage. A tweet directed toward Lizard Squad asked \"You had fun by taking down servers. Can we have fun for leak-*cough* giving out this?\"\n\nThere seems to be a distinct difference in the reasoning behind H4LT's actions and those of Lizard Squad. While the latter seemed content with an all-out attack, H4LT are of the opinion that the work that they are doing is for a positive purpose -- one tweet from earlier this morning suggested that referring to them as a 'hacker group' is inaccurate.\n\nThe group then went on to make a statement to TheTechGame when asked about the leak, stressing that they shared the files to encourage creativity within the community. According to H4LT's representative, the \"squad's\" intention is to make it possible to run homebrew applications on the Xbox One, and the SDK was leaked for these reasons:\n\nWe leaked it to the community because if something is shared then.. progress is achieved faster than alone.\n\nSomething kept between us will not achieve anything. Share it with the community = creativity and research. Shared is how it should be.\n\nThe SDK will basically allow the community to reverse and open doors towards homebrew applications being present on the Xbox One.\n\nH4LT would seem to have noble intentions with their leak - or so they claim - but there are certainly questions to be asked as to whether the ends justify the means. Giving such broad access to the SDK will likely accelerate the possibility of homebrew for the Xbox One, but it does so in a way that could potentially cause more harm than good to the reputation of the scene at large.\n\nWhether they like it or not, comparisons between H4LT and Lizard Squad will quickly be drawn as the story hits mainstream media. Given the way that the SDK has been circulated, not to mention the links between homebrew and piracy, H4LT is walking a fine line between being video game freedom fighters and out-and-out criminal \"hackers\" or whatever you want to label them or they want to label themselves.\n\nWhat do you think about H4LT's leak of the Xbox One SDK?\n\nSource: TheTechGame\n\nTAGS: Microsoft, Xbox, Xbox One",

"eng-1245497", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "These days, it seems in nearly every form of media that an established brand, a household name, or a recognizable star is all but mandatory for a big-budget investment. In gaming, the holiday season alone shows that mentality at work, with October and November filled with the biggest publishers marching forward yearly installments of the biggest moneymaking franchises. But that's not always the case.\n\nSometimes - as was the case this year - brand new projects can manage to grab consumer attention, console exclusivity, and the enthusiasm of previously-overlooked gamers. It's important to note that our choices for the most impressive new IPs in gaming aren't simply the best releases not tied to an existing license, but ones that have every intention of becoming the next big name. In the indie, online, or AAA market, these games showed their competition that a breath of fresh air (and a need to succeed) can make all the difference.\n\nWithout further ado, here are our choices for The 5 Best New Video Game IPs of 2014:\n\n-\n\nTitanfall\n\nFew games have been as confidently promised to challenge Call of Duty's market share of competitive online shooters as Titanfall; from the mind(s) behind Advanced Warfare - the game credited with 'changing everything' - its blend of infantry and mechanized combat made it the Xbox One's most coveted exclusive. It may have been released later than hoped (and bound for a less glorious fate), but its mark is a lasting one.\n\nIn the end, the lack of content and a traditional single player campaign didn't help with either reviews or longevity, but for a first release, Respawn Entertainment didn't disappoint where many others have. Introducing new and sure-to-be-copied elements into the online arena shooter and simply working (something that other 2014 games would struggle with) made Titanfall a household name. Now, the only question is just how much the franchise's direction will change in the future.\n\n-\n\nWatch_Dogs\n\nIt may not be the most shocking entry on our list, since Ubisoft was banking on Watch_Dogs becoming the latest AAA open world title in their stable (with big screen adaptation plans before it even released). Gamers didn't know at the time that the controversy surrounding the version of the game promised and the one released would become a familiar refrain for the publisher by year's end, but the strengths of the game shone through for many.\n\nThere's no shortage of open world, third-person action games set against an urban backdrop, but the hacking powers wielded by star Aiden Pearce over the city of Chicago gave Watch_Dogs enough to stand apart. Pair that with and online component that came as a genuine surprise, and a story that was just as unexpected, and it's safe to say Ubisoft earned yet another tentpole franchise - and one series poised to make even more of next-gen hardware.\n\n-\n\nThe Banner Saga\n\nThough it may have slipped by many consumers in a year filled with heavily-marketed titles, the art style of The Banner Saga alone is sure to turn heads even months after its release. As one of the great Kickstarters gaming success stories to date, the classical animation-inspired, turn-based strategy adventure is hard to describe for those who didn't try it out themselves.\n\nChallenging players to not only handle a variety of soldiers in a unique twist on old school combat, but make executive decisions to keep a caravan of hundred alive through a harsh winter, The Banner Saga is an experience all its own. It may not have been perfect - or for every player - but the first entry in Stoic's series (now that a sequel is officially announced) represents just how varied the modern definition of a 'successful video game' has become.\n\n-\n\nSunset Overdrive\n\nIt was enough of a coup when Insomniac Games announced that they would be leaving their PlayStation-exclusive franchises to craft a brand new IP (described as a return to the company's Spyro and Ratchet & Clank roots). But when the studio unveiled the first look at the world of Sunset Overdrive, audiences prepared themselves for disappointment, since no game could keep the visual style, the irreverence, and off-the-wall insanity intact in the gameplay itself.\n\nIncredibly, Sunset Overdrive managed to do just that. Favoring fun over all else (in both the campaign and co-op multiplayer) and relying on a rock-solid gameplay foundation to get it done, players were able to feel in control in even the most ridiculous scenarios. Sunset remains one of the must-have titles for the Xbox One, and that alone makes its future as rock-solid as Insomniac and Microsoft desire.\n\n-\n\nDestiny\n\nWhat is there to say about Bungie's space-faring MMO that hasn't been said already? While in truth, Destiny may not have been quite the game that Halo fans were hoping for, there's no denying just how quickly it cemented itself as a franchise audiences should get used to hearing about. Too many pretenders have come and gone in the past few years to recall, but Destiny immediately claimed the title of one of the best and most successful MMOs in recent memory - and it did it on consoles, no less.\n\nWhatever expectations may have existed, the number of hours we spent diving through its many dungeons and grinding for better and better loot prove how quickly the game can become an addiction. Even with its admitted shortcomings or drawbacks, Destiny is sure to be the best game of the year for many. There's no telling what plans Bungie and Activision have for it, but this series is here to stay.\n\n-\n\nThese games proved that you don't need an established brand or hero to find success (on a sliding scale). But they certainly aren't the only ones that accomplished the feat - and some smaller hits may prove to be long-running franchises if their developers and publishers decide that they've got the staying power. Be sure to offer your own choices for the most impressive debuts from 2014 in the comments below.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @andrew_dyce.\n\nTAGS: Destiny, Sunset Overdrive, The Banner Saga, titanfall,

For this reason, the beginning of each month is an exceptionally exciting time for gamers who subscribe to PlayStation and/or Xbox services. It is at this time that Sony and Microsoft's subscription services roll over and give way to a new batch of downloadable goodies both discounted and free. The free titles on both of these services are often headlined by heavy-hitters of the past year or two and with the announcement of January's offerings, it's looking to be no different.\n\nBeginning with Sony's PlayStation Plus service, the headlining game on PS4 for the first month of 2015 will be the standalone expansion for Sucker Punch's open world superpowered romp, Infamous: Second Son. The expansion - First Light - places players in control of the game's neon-fuelled Fetch as they get insight into her backstory. Considering the immense success of Second Son (check out our review), this is likely to be one of the most exciting free offerings of the month.\n\nIn addition to First Light, PS4 users will also be able to pick up the The Swapper. Combining a compelling story with mind-bending puzzles, it's well-deserving of its place as one of 2013's top indie titles. Not to be left out, gamers with a PS3 and PlayStation Plus will have access to Prototype 2 and DuckTales Remastered. On the handheld front, Vita owners can chew bubble gum and download Duke Nukem 3D: Megaton Edition to their heart's content in addition to picking up Woah Dave! from the people behind the BIT.TRIP series.\n\nIn contrast to the PlayStation Plus offerings, Microsoft's Games With Gold promotion for Xbox Live Gold subscribers will highlight one of the year's most underrated titles: D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die. Coming from Deadly Premonition director Hidetako Suehiro, Xbox One owners will have a chance to pick up this off-the-wall time-travelling murder mystery for free beginning January 1st.\n\nXbox 360 users can expect to pick up MX vs. ATV Alive in the first half of January with The Witcher 2 becoming available from January 16th until the end of the month. Having both received favorable reviews, it's safe to say that even Xbox 360 owners should be excited to add this month's offerings to their digital collections. Plus, with The Witcher 3 well on its way to release, there's no better time than now to jump feet-first into CD Projekt RED's incredible RPG series.\n\nLooking at the roster of free releases that will be kicking off the new year, it's clear that gamers are going to have ample opportunity to fill their free time. While it's impossible to compare the two services, its hard to deny the value of these loyalty programs. With nearly eight million subscribers on PlayStation Plus alone, it will be interesting to see how these services continue to grow and evolve in the coming year.\n\nWhile Nintendo has yet to throw their hat into the ring in a similar capacity, there's no telling what 2015 will hold for the house that Mario built. Their Club Nintendo program has seen success among its users but as time goes on, it would be interesting to see how it could continue to develop to embraces the digital age. With a new year comes new possibilities, so it's anyone's guess as to where Nintendo will take their existing services. If the release of Mewtwo in Super Smash Bros. is any indication, this could be the start of something big for the Big N.\n\n_____\n\nFollow Ryan on Twitter @ThatRyanB.\n\nSource: PlayStation Blog, Major Nelson\n\nTAGS: D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die, DuckTales Remastered, Duke Nukem 3D, inFAMOUS Second Son, Microsoft, MX vs. ATV Alive, Prototype 2, PS3, PS4, Sony, The Witcher 2, Vita, Xbox 360, Xbox One", "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "wgt": 3, "time": "12:14:00", "uri": "237966971", "url": "http://gamerant.com/january-2015-ps-plus-games-with-gold/", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "\u2018Infamous: First Light\u2019 & \u2018D4\u2032 Lead January PS Plus & Games With Gold Offerings"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "type": "loc", "score": 2, "id": "3585", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"id": "15599", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game"}}, {"id": "16038", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"id": "16308", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer network"}}, {"id": "16572", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17242", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"id": "19881", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hard disk drive"}}, {"id": "19960", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_development", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game development"}}, {"id": "20508", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broadband"}}, {"id": "22252", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"id": "22284", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dial-up Internet access"}}, {"id": "23043", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Live"}}, {"id": "29888", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamer"}}, {"id": "31652", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"id": "40673", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox 360"}}, {"id": "61427", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Programming language"}}, {"id": "71869", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft XNA"}}, {"id": "75068", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_chat", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice chat"}}, {"id": "80308", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dreamcast"}}, {"id": "101376", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sega"}}, {"id": "111141", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Killer application"}}, {"id": "144435", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_2", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Halo 2"}}, {"id": "199310", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/56_kbit/s_modem", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "56 kbit/s modem"}}], "categories": [{"id": 99, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 543, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Sports", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 710, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Driving and Racing", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Driving_and_Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 848, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Console Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Console_Platforms", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 876, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Fighting", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Fighting", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25493857", "source": {"id": "4104", "uri": "gamerant.com", "title": "Game Rant"}, "eventUri": "eng-1243620", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Microsoft may have popularized the idea of the online network for consoles, but they weren't the first to build one: that honor goes to Sega. Two full years before Xbox Live launched, the Tokyo-based game maker unleashed SegaNet on the gaming public. The subscription-based service was revolutionary; an integral part of the just-released Sega Dreamcast, SegaNet allowed console gamers to log into a central hub and compete against friends and strangers online - all through the power of a 56K modem and dial-up connection.\n\nWhen the Dreamcast proved to be nowhere near as popular as Sega hoped, the service was cancelled a mere 11 months after launch. That's where Xbox Live comes in.\n\nReleased in 2002, Xbox Live didn't just allow users to compete against one another but added a host of social features, including voice chat and a means to track online friends. Combined with the Xbox's hard drive, Xbox Live made it easy for developers to push out changes and sell digital content for their games. With killer apps like Unreal Championship and Halo 2 and a speedy broadband-only connection, Xbox Live created the template for online console gaming that's still in use today.\n\nXbox Live's success is largely the responsibility of one man: Boyd Multerer. Having joined Microsoft in 1997, Multerer went on to head the Xbox Live development team from 2000 to 2004 (and was the network's first official user), later creating Microsoft's XNA programming language - a now-defunct attempt to make console development more accessible to indie creators - before moving on to head the Xbox 360 OS team and finally, the Xbox One.\n\nAnd now, he's gone. After 17 years, Multerer has left Microsoft to pursue other ventures. The split seems largely amicable, as Multerer has explained on Twitter that \"Xbox Leadership is fine. On the other hand, I'm complicated,\" implying that his departure was more of a personal choice, and less of a conflict of personalities.\n\nGoodbye Microsoft. It was a good run. Xbox was Great! Time to do something new. -- Boyd Multerer (@BoydMulterer)\n\nDecember 29, 2014\n\nAs for what Multerer's working on next, he's not sharing. Revealed to be \"doing independent secret stuff\" at the moment, Multerer has used his Twitter page to reveal that his time off has led him back to his coding roots and \"exploring ideas.\" Whatever Multerer's up to, it seems that he has an active, hands-on role, as well as a large amount of creative freedom.\n\nXbox Live made consoles what they are today, while the XNA program provided many developers with their first taste of game development. Multerer is one of the true powerhouses of the industry, and putting him to work on a new, exciting project can only lead to good things. Keep an eye out for further announcements from Multerer, and don't be surprised to find that great things may be coming sooner rather than later.\n\nSource: Boyd Multerer\n\nTAGS: Microsoft, Xbox,

"isDuplicate": false, "body": "Part 2 Here's part two of El Reg's mobile industry review for 2014, where Andrew Orlowski picks out a few of the key trends. Click here for part one.\n\nWindows Phone made big strides in 2013, but was pegged back in 2014 for a number of reasons.\n\nMicrosoft got a hyperactive new CEO Satya Nadella, who regarded the Nokia mobile devices acquisition with the enthusiasm you show your cat when it brings home a dead sparrow and drops it on the living room carpet. His predecessor Steve Ballmer had wanted Microsoft to make top notch devices - or so we thought. More accurately, Microsoft just didn't want its biggest phone OEM to cool on making Windows Phones, and Nokia's board couldn't guarantee that it wouldn't. So Microsoft had to buy Nokia's mobile devices team.\n\nAnd so 32,000 Nokia staff swelled the ranks at Microsoft. Before the deal was even completed, Nadella removed \"devices\" from the strategy statement.\n\n(Nadella's replacement is a Hegelian obfuscation: \"Cloudobile\": Cloud and Mobile both come first. Together. At the same time. Skipping over the finishing line, hand in hand. Neither finishes second. It's all quite ridiculous, but Nadella thinks the more he repeats it, the more it will make sense).\n\nNadella then further showered more love on the acquisition by announcing that 12,000 of the 32,000 Nokia staff would be made redundant. And Microsoft cancelled the year end flagship - leaving it fighting on at the low end.\n\nNadella's new strategy also mandated that Microsoft products on the two dominant platforms were attractive and competitive. Office arrived on the iPad in March, and you now get very nice Office apps without paying a penny for a Office365 subscription.\n\nBut Nadella wasn't Windows Phone's only problem. The No.1 Priority was to rescue desktop Windows from the Sinofsky years, which now makes Vista look like a temporary aberration. So the custodians of Windows Phone, Terry Myerson and Joe Belfiore, were handed the job and so could only devote a small proportion of their time to the platform.\n\nIn their absences, it seemed as if Windows Phone was being run by people who didn't really like Windows Phone at all. The charm, coherence and deep integration that made WP such an unusual Microsoft project got lost in the shift to version 8.1. By October, WP was being compared to Android. And not in a good way.\n\nThe Nadella strategy means that there's no flagship or \"hero\" loss leader for mature markets - the \"McLaren\" imaging Lumia having been cancelled. But you can pick up no-name Windows Phones from Argos and quite serviceable Nokia-branded Lumia for under \u00a360 - thanks to Microsoft removing royalties from the platform.\n\nIt's a fine deal, and makes sense. Because the value of the ecosystem is \"priced in\", high-end Lumias can't compete with high-end Samsungs.\n\nHTC, meanwhile, conspicuously failed to make the WP version of its beautiful One M8 a global product. No OEM is a charity, so Windows Phone suits emerging markets and here, nicely suits the no nonsense, white van segment who was happy with a featurephone. But without a flagship to boast about, what hope does the platform have for future growth? It's widely expected that the \"Phone\" will be dropped from the marketing in 2015, but whatever it's called, the franchise is in need of a reboot, and renewed loving care and attention.\n\nA year ago BlackBerry was at rock bottom, but with an experienced turnaround crew at the helm, and a coherent strategy, it set the groundwork for a revival. This is based around its BES12 server, and the strategy can be summed up as follows. It's all about business - if you're a fan or a consumer, you're on your own. BlackBerry thinks device management (the big hope two years ago) has become commoditised, yet it has a huge asset by owning its own network. So it has devised lots of value-added services that are really quite slick, thanks to the network. Quite a lot of these look quite relevant in a post-Snowden, post-Sony hack world.\n\nBlackBerry also released two new devices, an eye-catching and odd phablet with a novel \"swipeable\" hardware keyboard called the Passport, and the Classic which revives the abandoned but fondly regarded vintage interface.\n\nAt least the Passport got BlackBerry talked about again. Away from the mainstream media's attention, BB10 has matured nicely too. It needs a broader range of devices - a narrower Passport, a Classic with more modern hardware to attract the independent professional - but this all depends on business nibbling at BES12 in 2015.\n\nChinese manufacturers Xiaomi and Huawei took 3rd and 4th spot in global handset sales in 2015. Nobody wants to distribute branded Xiaomi and Huawei handsets here in the UK, but they are seeping into Spain and Italy. Huawei's not spending any money to change that, buying its way into distribution or consciousness here. The quality and design are now excellent, particularly from Huawei, I discovered, although the Ascend P7 used Huawei's own chips and felt underpowered. EE's Kestrel (a \u00a399 4G 'Droid) was China's biggest success in the UK and sold well.\n\nWith a reputation as poundshop Apple, Xiaomi was valued at $45bn. Why? Because it overtook Samsung in China? Because it \"has services too\" (er, which turns out to be a chat app, and bring in negligible revenue)? Because the founder is to Steve Jobs what Psy is to Tupac? Not really. A Russian speculator has invested in Xiaomi and hyped it to the heavens. It's all quite odd.\n\nAt least Steve Jobs didn't have a monopoly on Reality Distortion Fields.\n\nPolicy uncertainty looms large over the market, particularly in Europe. The new Commission is more sympathetic to pan-European mega mergers, which mobile operators have wanted for years. But it's not lost its taste for ad hoc intervention, which even the UK caught. The European Parliament fixed roaming prices in Europe, so operators put up prices for roaming outside Europe, and bumped up Pay As You Go tariffs. Which means people who never leave the UK (poor people) now subsidise those who can expense their mobile bills. You've got to love the new, fair, egalitarian Europe!\n\nThe stealth story to watch is Europe's increasing hostility to Google and Facebook, which are no longer viewed as cuddly and transformative. If the EU is serious about giving European services a level playing field, it knows it needs to tackle platform monopolies. The year's most unexpected story was Europe's determination to probe the Android empire - extending into wearables and even Google's prototype \"Lego\" phone. With manufacturers suddenly struck mute, the EU demanded they talk, or be fined.\n\nCompetition Commissioner Almunia (who enjoyed a cosy relationship with Google) has gone, and New Age space cadet Neelie Kroes - who in your correspondent's opinion turned her department into a taxpayer-funded Silicon Valley happy chappy - has gone too, with three Commissioners clearing up her mess.

Google's been working out the kinks, however, as evidenced by a recent thread in the AOSP bug tracker. One particular fix, for rampant use of RAM, is reportedly slated to show up in the next Android update.\n\nThe issue tracker mentions a memory leak that causes apps either to run slowly or to crash without any warning. Android 5.0.1 apparently takes up as much as 1.3GB of RAM, which is particularly detrimental to devices that top out at 2GB. There are even a few Reddit threads devoted to complaints about this particular issue.\n\nA ticket for the RAM issue opened up on Google's AOSP issue tracker about a month ago. This week Google marked the issue as \"FutureRelease,\" which means the next version update will include a fix for this annoyance.\n\nWhy this matters: Years of dealing with Apple, Microsoft, and Google's software updates have taught us there's no such thing as a smooth rollout. Regardless, there's a lot at stake when it comes to the Android operating system, especially considering that it already has a reputation of fragmentation and delayed software updates.\n\nWith Google's new slogan being \"Be together, not the same,\" it needs to be more quick about fixing minor issues and ensuring OS stability across the board.

While I'm sure Platinum appreciates the praise, chances are that the studio doesn't need us to motivate it to move forward with the character. She's clearly its favorite, as evidenced by her starring role in two games, her own animated movie, and guest appearances in other Platinum titles like The Wonderful 101 and Anarchy Reigns. Platinum has already teased more Bayonetta for 2015, and seeing as its the first day of that year, I suppose it's possible that a new Bayonetta game could be announced any second now.\n\nSadly, those possibilities will inevitably be tempered by the reality that Bayonetta is not a proven money maker. Though the original game got plenty of press and sold well by some standards, it apparently didn't do well enough to earn the confidence of most publishers. It's well documented that if it weren't for Nintendo swooping in to the rescue, Bayonetta 2 would never have happened. While the sequel clearly has its fans, we haven't heard much regarding the game's sales, making it easy to guess that Nintendo isn't particularly proud of how it performed.\n\nSo where does that leave the future of Bayonetta? Do you think Microsoft or Sony will bankroll Bayonetta 3 after the second outing's critical success? Maybe Platinum and Sega will pull back on the budget a bit and make a 2D action title for Bayo on the Vita or 3DS, perhaps in the style of Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia or Viewtiful Joe?", "sim": 0.3764705955982208, "wgt": 2, "time": "13:00:00", "uri": "238013666", "url": "http://www.destructoid.com/what-are-you-hoping-for-in-the-next-bayonetta-game--285598.phtml", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "What are you hoping for in the next Bayonetta game?"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "score": 2, "id": "70", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "score": 2, "id": "219", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"id": "15756", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price"}}, {"id": "15779", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"id": "16042", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"id": "16220", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"id": "16234", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "18368", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"id": "18546", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"id": "30282", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC.com"}}, {"id": "31872", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital"}}, {"id": "44859", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_ruble", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian ruble"}}, {"label": {"eng": "Burning Man"}, "type": "loc", "score": 2, "id": "67030", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Man", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burning Man"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"id": "74999", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arbitrage"}}, {"id": "237522", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital currency"}}, {"id": "722405", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"id": "725452", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}], "categories": [{"id": 20, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 23, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Banks", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Banks", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 57, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 84, "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 271, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 364, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Venture Capital", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Venture_Capital", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 420, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25495630", "source": {"id": "3", "uri": "www.ibtimes.co.uk", "title": "International Business Times UK"}, "eventUri": "eng-1236681", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Bitcoin has been called the worst investment of 2014, even worse than crude oil or the Russian rouble(Reuters)\n\nThe value of popular digital currency bitcoin declined by about 58% in 2014 - the cryptocurrency's most trying year.\n\nAccording to calculations done by IBTimes UK, based on historical price data provided by CoinDesk, bitcoin opened at $757.49 on 1 January, 2014 and ended the year at $319.70, representing a value decline of 57.8%.\n\nBitcoin rates peaked at $951.39 on 6 January and there after plunged to the lowest level for the year at $309.87 on 30 December. The cryptocurrency is trading down 1.52% at $314.83 as of 8:11 am BST.\n\nThe value decline was despite increased venture capital inflows into the bitcoin industry and adaption of the digital currency by a number of prominent companies during the year.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of central banks have voiced their concerns over digital currencies and have warned customers of the risks involved.\n\nIn December, tech giant Microsoft announced that it would accept bitcoin as payment for digital services. In July, PC maker Dell introduced bitcoin payments for online customers in the US following a partnership with Coinbase.\n\nOther big companies that adopted bitcoin payments in 2014 include Dish, Expedia and Overstock.com.\n\nCoinDesk earlier reported that the amount of venture capital flowing into bitcoin startups this year is more than three times the total raised in 2013. Overall, bitcoin firms raised $314.7m in 2014. This represents a 3.3-fold increase year-on-year, in which $93.8m was invested.\n\nHowever, Charlie Shrem, who was CEO at bitcoin firm BitInstant and a former member at Bitcoin Foundation, was sentenced in December to two years in prison for assisting notorious online black market Silk Road adding to the negative reputation of the currency.\n\nThe Mt Gox disaster, in which customers lost 650,000 bitcoins via an alleged hacking attack, still remains unresolved. A number of bitcoin businesses such as Bitcoin Trader, a popular arbitrage service in the digital currency, failed during the year adding to the woes of the industry.\n\nThe future of bitcoin\n\nDespite its weakness in 2014, the digital currency is expected to fare well in the future with stable prices and favourable regulations.\n\n\"Regardless of the price, it was a huge year for bitcoin,\" Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer at BitPay, told CNBC.\n\n\"A year ago people didn't know if bitcoin was a fad, but today it's for sure that it's going to stay for a long time.\"\n\nGovernments around the world are currently considering bitcoin regulations, with the US planning to introduce BitLicense for the bitcoin businesses.\n\n\"We are very close to getting a regulatory framework in place, and that will be a huge boon for the industry,\" Brendan O'Connor, managing director for trading at SecondMarket, was quoted as saying by CNBC.\n\n\"Once it's more black and white, you are going to see more institutional folks buying into the asset class, and the price will go up,\" O'Connor added.\n\nRelatedBitcoin would help in transition towards cashless society,

life easier for most of us, but not for the IT staffers who have to keep it up and running. Whether an app is designed to summon a cab, check the weather, or search job postings, it has to be painstakingly tested and configured so it works even during upgrades and other potentially disruptive changes. Many companies spend more than 90 percent of their IT budgets on such thankless scut work, says Al Gillen, an analyst at researcher IDC.\n\nThat helps explain the rise of Docker. In less than two years the company's free software has become a building block in app development at thousands of companies, and it's supported by Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOG), IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT), and VMware (VMW). Docker automatically rearranges programmers' code into virtual \"containers\" that are preconfigured and standardized to work on most any hardware setup, shaving weeks or months off the process of sending an app into the world. \"This is about the mass commoditization of the production of software,\" says founder Solomon Hykes, who named the company and its software after longshoremen. \"Docker can have the same impact on software that shipping containers had on world trade.\"\n\nIBM, Google, and other companies had designed and used their own container technologies for years, but Hykes was the first to establish an industry standard. He did that by creating an easy-to-use interface and by making Docker an open-source project, freeing other tech companies that contributed code to create software and services they could sell to Docker users. Although Hykes and Chief Executive Officer Ben Golub have yet to demonstrate that they can make money selling versions of the software with extra features, they've raised $55 million in venture capital, including a $40 million round in September that valued the company at more than $400 million, says a person familiar with the financing who wasn't authorized to discuss it publicly. \"There's an awful lot of momentum behind Docker, because it solves a lot of problems the industry has had for a long time,\" says IDC's Gillen.\n\nHykes, a 30-year-old Frenchman with a master's degree in computer science from the European Institute of Technology, got the idea for Docker while working in a string of jobs, where he had to spend most of his time writing app-launching software over and over. In 2007 he quit a $40,000-a-year job in Los Angeles and moved back to his mom's basement in Paris to work on his pet project with friends. He and one of his pals landed a spot in the 2010 class of Y Combinator, the San Francisco startup accelerator. They launched a company called DotCloud and, after raising about $10 million in venture capital, decided to stay in the U.S. \"He's always known where he wanted to go,\" says Docker board member Marc Vestraen, an Apple (AAPL) engineering manager. The two met through Tay Son Vo Dao, a Vietnamese martial arts club, and still try to practice together twice a week.\n\nPhotograph by Talia Herman for Bloomberg BusinessweekThe mascot\n\nDotCloud earned technical accolades but struggled to find customers. In April 2013, Hykes announced at PyCon, an industry conference, that he'd converted the software, now called Docker, into an open-source project. Within hours, dozens of companies began to experiment with Docker and contribute code to improve it. Programmers at hundreds of companies, from little-known startups to Goldman Sachs (GS), have downloaded the free code more than 77 million times, the company says. Hykes and his wife, Coralie, a fellow martial artist and a biotech engineer who became a florist when the couple moved to San Francisco, have swapped their tiny apartment for a row house in the trendy NoPa (North of Panhandle Park) neighborhood. Hykes recently replaced his broken-down 2001 Volkswagen Golf with the 2014 model.\n\nMillions of downloads are one thing, commercialization another. Docker, which now has 70 employees in an office stuffed with picnic tables, ferns, and a pet tortoise, has less than $10 million in annual revenue, says the person familiar with its finances. The company's free roots make the job tougher, says Luke Kanies, who created a popular open-source system called Puppet. For companies like his, Kanies says, \"the major thing people love about you is that you're free.\"\n\nPhotograph by Talia Herman for Bloomberg BusinessweekThe pet tortoise\n\nFor Hykes, that problem became clear when Docker took its first sizable step toward building a business on Dec. 4, introducing a subscription-based online service called Docker Hub Enterprise aimed at managing containers for large companies. On the same day, CoreOS CEO Alex Polvi, who built his business selling server software designed to work well with Docker, blogged that Docker's business model was \"fundamentally flawed\" and that the industry should coalesce behind his company's new container software, called Rocket. Furious, Hykes issued a series of emotional tweets in response, calling Rocket \"a copy-paste of our own explicit design roadmap\" and accusing CoreOS of trying to manufacture controversy. Hykes has since apologized. \"I'd give myself an 'F' on that. I overreacted,\" he says.\n\nThe Docker founder says he's not worried about rival container software but acknowledges that he has work to do to persuade other companies to continue contributing code to Docker and developing products for its users as the company starts trying to turn a profit. \"The onus is on us,\" he says, \"to prove we're not out to steal anyone's business but to create a level playing field.\"", "sim": 0.3568627536296844, "wgt": 2, "time": "14:01:00", "uri": "237978617", "url": "http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-12-18/docker-makes-popular-software-to-manage-apps-dot-can-it-make-money?hootPostID=49803935039353b82987882e376f2779", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Growing Your Apps in Isolation"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "15666", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Website"}}, {"id": "16323", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Wide Web"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17433", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"id": "19969", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rendering (computer graphics)"}}, {"id": "27706", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"id": "38717", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet Explorer"}}, {"id": "48828", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fork (software development)"}}, {"id": "63950", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_engine", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft engine"}}, {"id": "98455", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibility_mode", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compatibility mode"}}, {"id": "114911", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_bar", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Address bar"}}, {"id": "129739", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(layout_engine)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trident (layout engine)"}}, {"id": "718251", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 8"}}], "categories": [{"id": 70, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 1068, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 1164, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 1165, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Flags", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Flags", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 1166, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Flags/Regional", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Flags/Regional", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25497029", "source": {"id": "11319", "uri": "www.neowin.net", "title": "Neowin"}, "eventUri": "eng-1246570", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Microsoft has moved ahead with Internet Explorer's new forked rendering engine, including it in the latest 'official' build of Windows 10.

That's the hacker group whose name is suddenly on everyone's lips after it took credit for ruining Christmas for PlayStation and Xbox gamers everywhere.\n\nBut in an unusual interview, a self-proclaimed member of the \"cyberterrorist\" group said Lizard Squad also played a role in the massive attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. A person identifying himself as a Lizard Squad administrator said the group provided a number of Sony employee logins to Guardians of Peace, the organization that allegedly broke into Sony's network and prompted the film studio to initially withdraw \"The Interview\" from theaters.\n\nIf true, it would be the first open acknowledgment by a Lizard Squad member that the group was involved in the Sony attack. The administrator also conceded that the group went too far in August, when it tweeted a bomb threat to American Airlines, prompting the midflight diversion of a jet carrying Sony executive John Smedley by F-16 fighters. He also shed more light on the group's membership, saying most are based in the European Union and Eastern Europe and therefore aren't too worried about FBI investigations into Lizard Squad.\n\nTo help show he was a controlling member of the Lizard Squad, the individual published a confirmation tweet from a Twitter account closely associated with the group, @LizardMafia (a message that I saw but unfortunately didn't screen-capture before it got deleted). The administrator gave his name as \"a Ryan Cleary,\" but further questioning revealed he was not the same Ryan Cleary who was convicted of hacking into the CIA and other agencies as part of the hacking group LulzSec. While we may never be able to prove for certain that @LizardMafia and its affiliated website actually speak for the real Lizard Squad -- or that Lizard Squad is in fact behind the attacks against Sony and Microsoft -- I was at least able to determine that \"Ryan Cleary\" commands a substantial following of people who believe he represents Lizard Squad.\n\nWhat follows is an edited transcript of our conversation, which was conducted in a private online chat room.\n\nBrian Fung: So, I guess one of the first questions everyone will want an answer to is ... how can we be sure you're Lizard Squad?\n\nRyan Cleary: Uh, it says this (chat room) on the Twitter account. (At this point, Cleary turns to another administrator in the chat room and asks him to add a \"confirmation file\" to the Lizard Squad website.) Also, I emailed you to come here.\n\nQ. But let's just say I was some random person who doesn't know a thing about Lizard Squad -- wouldn't I assume that somebody unconnected to Lizard Squad could have just made up your email address? Or made up the Twitter account but separately from the folks who are actually running Lizard Squad?\n\nA. Well, you could verify the email based on the Twitter account. (Cleary turns to the other administrator and again asks for a file to be added to the website for verification.) There should be a verification tweet for you on @lizardmafia: https://twitter.com/LizardMafia/status/548564027522445313\n\nQ. I think so. So the big question surrounding this latest PlayStation Network/Xbox Live incident is, why, and why now? What do you hope to accomplish with it?\n\nA. Well, one of our biggest goals is to have fun, of course. But we're also exposing massive security issues with these companies people are trusting their personal information with. The customers of these companies should be rather worried.\n\nQ. In this case it seems less like a leak of personal information than an attack that simply makes the services crash. What does overloading a system have to do with security flaws?\n\nA. Quite a bit. It tells you how much money they've put into securing their systems. Not having people take down your business critical systems like this should be one of your top security priorities. Which it clearly isn't.\n\nQ. So if I understand correctly, you're saying Sony and Microsoft's systems should be able to scale to handle all this incoming traffic.\n\nA. Absolutely. We told them almost a month before that we'd do this. And yet we had no difficulties dropping them.\n\nQ. How much data are, or were, you throwing at them per second?\n\nA. Not really, no. Unless this counts as a game. I guess this is kind of a game for us.\n\nQ. Tell me more.\n\nA. Well, it's often sort of like a game of chess. Your opponent does something to prevent your attack, and you alter your attack to get around your opponents' defenses.\n\nQ. What do you think Sony and Microsoft's countermove will be?\n\nA. Good question. So far only Sony has actually tried to defend against us. They made a deal with a large DDoS protection company, Prolexic, after apparently deciding they stood no chance against us in-house.\n\nQ. Microsoft put up no resistance?\n\nA. None we could detect. And if we can't tell they're trying to stop us, does it even matter?\n\nQ. What kind of group are you, would you say? If you had to describe yourself?\n\nA. Well, we've been humorously describing ourselves as a cyberterrorist group. I mean, referring to us as a hacker/hacking group would probably be the simplest choice.\n\nQ. Some reports suggest you've got links to Guardians of Peace, and possibly to the Islamic State. Can you talk about that for a minute?\n\n(Another long pause, about five minutes.)\n\nA. Well, we do know some people from the GOP (Guardians of the Peace). We do not have any links to the IS (Islamic State).\n\nQ. But you didn't work with Guardians of Peace to breach Sony's network and gain access to the emails, etc.? In other words, you know some people but weren't involved in the Sony hack surrounding \"The Interview\"?\n\nA. We handed over some Sony employee logins to them. For the initial hack.\n\nQ. Like, a lot of them? And how did you come by them yourselves?\n\nA. We came by them ourselves. It was a couple.\n\n(Another pause that's punctuated by several connection errors.)", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "wgt": 2, "time": "14:28:00", "uri": "237980711", "url":

Although gun violence remains the leading cause of death among young people, our most dangerous weapon is still our fork. Forty-five times as many die of chronic diseases linked to a diet containing animal products, sugar and salt.\n\nHardly a month goes by without another study linking consumption of animal products with obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain cancers. No reputable study has ever shown an opposite result.\n\nBut times are changing. Hundreds of schools, colleges, hospitals and corporate cafeterias, have embraced Meatless Monday. According to a Gallup poll, 22 percent of American consumers are avoiding meat and 12 percent are avoiding dairy products. Harris Interactive claims that 47 percent of American consumers are reducing consumption of animal products.\n\nAccordingly, plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy products are growing explosively, propelled by investments from Microsoft, Paypal, and Twitter founders. Fast-food chains like Chipotle, Subway and Taco Bell are rolling out vegan options.\n\nLet this New Year's resolution be about exploring the rich variety of plant-based entrees, lunch meats, cheeses, ice creams, and milks in our supermarket. The internet offers tons of recipes and transition tips.\n\nJames Eichberg\n\nPrescott", "sim": 0.8156862854957581, "wgt": 2, "time": "14:30:00", "uri": "237981032", "url": "http://dcourier.com/Main.asp?SectionID=36&SubSectionID=73&ArticleID=140156", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Letter: Nutrition concern"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17242", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"id": "30085", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Call of Duty"}}, {"id": "40673", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox 360"}}, {"id": "43028", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Game of Thrones"}}, {"id": "53620", "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Hryb", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Larry Hryb"}}, {"id": "85540", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telltale_Games", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telltale Games"}}, {"id": "97229", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Dead Redemption"}}, {"id": "109922", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orange_Box", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Orange Box"}}, {"id": "113917", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bull_shark", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bull shark"}}, {"id": "158643", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_III", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diablo III"}}, {"id": "196108", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden_NFL", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madden NFL"}}, {"id": "201573", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Island", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dead Island"}}, {"id": "221852", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Noire", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "L.A.

gadgets and gizmos on dock for release in 2015, highlighted by the new Apple Watch in the spring, many lower priced and more consumer friendly drones and a new version of Microsoft Windows.\n\nBut which ones are consumers most excited about?\n\nWe set out to find out this week, by strolling Ocean Front Walk here and talking to tourists from around the USA and the globe.\n\nThe Apple Watch (expected in the spring, starting at $350.) Apple's new smart device for the wrist is \"a nice piece of equipment, but it's not for me,\" says Jacob Matson of London.\n\nPhyllisa Reams of Long Beach, California is sold. She's buying. I'm still thinking about it, but most likely I will purchase one.\n\n\"More than just checking the time, like on a phone, you can look up lots of things on your wrist, get on the Internet, and not have to pick up the phone. And flip through it.\"\n\nMicrosoft is touting the sequel to Windows 8, skipping 9 and going all the way to 10, with a new operating system designed to be more mobile focused.\n\n\"I have the current Windows,\" said Israel Szpigel, visiting from Long Island, New York. \"I don't know anything about Windows 10.\"\n\nBut tourist Reno Farnesi of Philadelphia was up on it, and looking forward to it. New versions of Windows \"usually get faster,\" he said.\n\nNo Apple Watch for him either. He was the one tourist we encountered already wearing a smartwatch--by Pebble, which he liked, because it's compatible with both Apple's IOS software and Google's Android.\n\nMany analysts are predicting that 4K Ultra-HD TVs will come of age in 2015, with more models to choose from at lower prices.\n\nBut the folks we met out here weren't biting.\n\n\"4K TV is...I'm still waiting for them to broadcast more in 4K,\" said Andrew Andrew, of Montreal, citing the programming shortage of buying a 4K TV only to find most shows in 1K. \"They don't broadcast enough in 4K.\"\n\nMatson says he would like one of the new curved TVs, which were introduced at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show.\n\n\"It could be cool. It's something different.\"\n\nFinally, drones are controversial, with many waiting for the FAA to update its rules for commercial use. Right now, they're approved for personal use--knocking out real estate agent, photographers and videographers and local businesses who want to use drones.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped the stampede of manufacturers who will invade the CES 2015 with many, many new drone models.\n\n\"I don't think I'll have one, but I'd love to use it,\" says Matson.\n\nWill there be a drone in your future?\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://on.wfmy.com/1zB5EaC", "sim": 0.4039215743541718, "wgt": 2, "time": "14:47:00", "uri": "237982660", "url":

choices holistically, toward sustainable lifestyle change without counting every calorie or step.\n\nSan Diego, CA (PRWEB) January 01, 2015\n\nThe SmartenFit app is a research-based healthy eating and fitness app that provides a holistic approach to wellness. The goal of SmartenFit is to help users adopt a sustainable healthy lifestyle - beyond New Year's resolutions. The app is for those looking for a simplified way to monitor their nutritional choices and exercise, and set realistic and attainable goals without having to count every calorie or step. The tips and tools in SmartenFit are complementary to the book \"Smart People Don't Diet\" by Dr. Charlotte Markey, a health psychology professor at Rutgers University. The advice in the book and the SmartenFit app is based on decades of scientific evidence from psychologists, nutritionists, public health professionals, and doctors.\n\nThe SmartenFit app features:\n\n\u00b7 News feed with research-based health tips, articles, and inspiration\n\n\u00b7 Healthier food alternative database which is vetted by a registered dietitian and updated frequently (New large scale update scheduled for mid-January)\n\n\u00b7 Food diary allowing for both photo and text entries\n\n\u00b7 BMI calculator\n\n\u00b7 Goal setting and reminders\n\n\u00b7 Personal dashboard with graphs to track your progress\n\nThe app is $2.99 and ad free. Future versions of the app may include a feature that allows users to submit a week of their food diary to a registered dietitian for review and feedback on their diet along with suggestions on how to improve their nutritional profile.\n\nSmartenFit was developed by three friends with PhD's and a common interest in health and wellness. Char, Lorie, and Jen met in their doctoral program at the University of California, Riverside in 1997 and have been friends ever since. Char became a world-renowned expert in health psychology and currently teaches at Rutgers University (http://www.CharlotteMarkey.com). Lorie became a data scientist and entrepreneur working in the domains of marketing research and education (http://coreducational.com/). Jen went on to become an expert in user experience and mobile innovation and has worked for several companies in Silicon Valley including Intuit, Microsoft, and America Online. As working mothers, they have all struggled to find easy ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Thus, the primary goal of SmartenFit is to provide a tool for regular people with busy lives that facilitates a path toward sustainable good health.\n\nPlease use the contact info below for a promo code:\n\nDr. Lorie Sousa, CEO and Founder, COREducational\n\ninfo(at)smartenfit(dot)com\n\nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/01/prweb12419443.htm", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "wgt": 2, "time": "15:10:00", "uri": "237984789", "url": "http://www.pressreleaserocket.net/smartenfit-app-release-targets-health-fitness-and-nutrition/24358/", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "SmartenFit App Release Targets Health, Fitness, and Nutrition"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "China"}, "type": "loc", "score": 3, "id": "44", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"id": "15812", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17433", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"id": "17491", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"id": "19970", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"id": "28021", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nokia"}}, {"id": "28429", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"id": "41552", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"id": "92233", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese New Year"}}, {"id": "429125", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handset", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handset"}}, {"id": "460904", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"label": {"eng": "Belfiore"}, "type": "loc", "score": 4, "id": "578335", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfiore", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfiore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"id": "720088", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Windows Phone"}}, {"id": "730395", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sina Weibo"}}], "categories": [{"id": 70, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 486, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 500, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 960, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25503388", "source": {"id": "714", "uri": "www.theverge.com", "title": "The Verge"}, "eventUri": "eng-1245403", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Microsoft has made pretty big Office news recently on both iOS and Android; its own Windows Phone, though?

Joe Belfiore -- long the most visible public face of Microsoft's mobile platform -- took to his Weibo account this week to explain the silence, saying that \"our Office team has not forgotten Windows Phone\" and to expect a bundle of announcements on a single event prior to Chinese New Year, which falls on February 19th. Windows Central notes that those announcements could come at Microsoft's Windows 10 event that's scheduled for January 21st, but Belfiore isn't saying. There's no official news yet on what new features or capabilities Office for Windows Phone might get.\n\nPosting the news to Weibo might seem unusual, but there's logic behind it: Belfiore says in the same posting that the company is working on new features \"specifically for the China market\" that will be revealed in the coming months. The country had also long been a priority for Nokia's handset division prior to Microsoft's purchase, which helped drive features in 2012's Windows Phone \"Tango\" update to significantly lower the hardware specs required to run the platform.\n\nUpdating a suite of business apps might not be the magic elixir that Microsoft needs to boost Windows Phone's narrow global market share -- but if

to be interesting technologically.\n\nCloudy future\n\nBusinesses and consumers will increasingly embrace cloud services offered by providers like Safaricom, Microsoft and Google.\n\nMicrosoft rolled out cloud services to its one billion customers.\n\nHead of Microsoft Enterprise Jared Spataro was in the country in November and said the company would continue deepening and strengthening its provision of online storage to customers.\n\nCryptic Communication\n\nIn 2014, Apple servers were hacked and nude images stored therein leaked. Sony servers were hacked and e-mails leaked. The PlayStation Network was hacked.\n\nConsumers are increasingly concerned about the effects and embarrassment of data breaches.\n\nIn 2015, more technology firms will seek security features for customers.\n\nWhatsapp, the world's most popular message service, also rolled out end-to-end message encryption option for its Android users and has promised to do the same to users on other platforms.\n\nThis means messages will only be read by either the sender or receiver. They cannot be intercepted. More companies will do the same to gain favour with clients.\n\nHigh-Tech Haute Couture\n\n2015 may be the year wearable technology achieves mainstream approval.\n\nThe Apple watch is expected to show up in 2015 and it should have the iPhone faithful salivating at the chance to have the Apple logo permanently on their person.\n\nSoon before going out, you could be asking if your Google glasses match the colour of your Samsung gear smartwatch as you adjust your Bluetooth headset.\n\nBird, plane or drone?\n\nIn 2015, it is expected that there will be more benevolent drones in the sky.\n\nUnmanned aerial vehicles will find civilian applications and increased use will help in newsgathering, rescue efforts mineral exploration and mapping.\n\nA Kenyan company promises to start delivering items using drones in 2015. That won't happen though, obviously.\n\nE-Commerce everywhere\n\nCompanies want to sell you more stuff in 2015 through the internet.\n\nJumia, Kaymu, Kilimall are some of the online portals Kenyans can go and shop and have goods delivered to their doorstep. Kenyans will log on for online shopping sprees.\n\nFabulous Phablet\n\nTablets have been getting thinner while phones are getting larger. The trend is expected to continue.\n\nGalaxy S6, the latest sequel in Samsung's galaxy line, will arrive in the first quarter of 2015.\n\nExpect software upgrades, sharper cameras, improved screen resolution and a faster processor as it will have crammed even more semi-conductors into an even smaller space.\n\nWith the release of the iPhone 6, the countdown to the next phone from apple has begun and a follow-up sporting the letter \"S\" maybe released. The world's most valuable company did not get there by slouching around.\n\nSony is also expected to bring the next version of its top of the range \"Z\" series with the Xperia Z4.", "sim":

"TechRadar"}, "eventUri": "eng-1240712", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "It goes without saying that we at TechRadar are a forward-thinking bunch. But while we spend much of our time gazing into the crystal ball, not everything that manifests is worth telling grandma about. Sure, we'll tell you that Apple is probably going to improve the camera on the iPhone 7, or that we'll be seeing more than a few 4K TVs at CES this year, but every so often we get to tell you about something that's going to change lives in a meaningful way.\n\nBecause sometimes you read about something and you know, almost instantly, that it's going to make the world a better place. There's a lot of exciting high-impact tech on the horizon, but we've picked out the five (well OK, maybe six) most imminent bits of technology that we believe are going to make the world a better place, and we should see them making waves this year.\n\n1. Skype Translator\n\nYou'd have to be a stone-cold luddite to not be impressed with Skype Translator. What Microsoft has pulled off is nothing short of a marvel, letting people of different languages converse in their native tongue in real time - all thanks to some clever tech that audibly translates every sentence to the other party. The implications will be huge: language learning for education; connecting with distant relatives; international business relationships. Heck, it could make for some interesting cyber dates...\n\nThe software is still in its early preview stage, but expect to see it roll out in full glory in 2015 with a number of compatible languages - and more to come down the line.\n\n2. Electric cars gain momentum\n\nThe electric car has had a slow and uncertain rise, but thanks to big players like Tesla we really feel like the electric vehicle's time has come. We don't need to tell you the environmental reasons why they're important, but why have they not gained more momentum thus far? The main drawback has been distance but that's starting to change. The Tesla Roadster is being upgraded to extend its range to 400 miles, and in four months time you'll be able to drive across the UK for no cost at all in a Tesla S. Tesla also wants you to know that it takes less time to swap the battery on your Tesla S than it does to fill a tank of gas.\n\n3. As will driverless cars\n\nThe driverless cars are coming and no one can stop them. Unless you've been living in a cave for the past three years you'll know that Google has been leading the charge in this area. It's just revealed the next evolution of its autonomous vehicle - now ready for the roads - but as with most things Google it won't be building the final product itself, but will enlist the help of established names in the field instead.\n\n2015 will be the year that driverless cars take a big leap forward, and will see the UK playing a significant role: four British locations will be host to driverless car trials starting this month, with the aim of teaching us how autonomous vehicles can be assimilated into our daily lives. That includes driverless buses.\n\n4. Cheap internet for the masses\n\nWe at TechRadar are big fans of Elon Musk, but it's his work on internet accessibility that we're probably most impressed by right now. Musk wants to offer unfettered, low cost internet to the masses via a fleet of micro-satellites. And by gosh he's going to do it.\n\nIn November Musk promised an announcement \"in 2 to 3 months\" and calendar fans will know that puts us at code red. Expect to hear more any day now.\n\nBut Musk isn't the only one. Google and Facebook are also working to bring widespread internet connectivity to the third world, and we can expect to see more developments in 2015.\n\n5. Health\n\nHealth is an area of technology that's so multi-faceted right now it can often feel too fragmented. But we believe that we're approaching a point where wearable, fitness-focused technology will become mainstream, health will be gamified, and suddenly everybody will care about their wellbeing. There's no guarantee that the smartwatch will stick around, but wearable technology is here to stay.\n\nThe key is to make the data meaningful - Jawbone is a great example of someone who's doing it right - rather than just telling us that we've walked 60 more steps than we did yesterday. Yes, gamifying it will help more people to take interest, but that information must then be turned into something that can make us fitter, healthier, more productive...\n\nBonus number 6: teleportation\n\nOK, this one might be a bit of a stretch but that doesn't make it entirely impossible. If there was one takeaway point from the discovery of the Higgs Boson it should have been that travelling at the speed of light may now be possible. Some thinkers on the Higgs Boson believe that by \"shutting off\" a person's Higgs field, they might be able to travel at this speed and potentially teleport from one place to another.\n\nOne response to this is that, to do so, you'd probably have to heat that person up by billions of degrees, which doesn't sound like much fun to us. But who knows - we may see teleportation one day become a reality after all. Just don't expect much to happen this year.", "sim": 0.4941176474094391, "wgt": 2, "time": "15:22:00", "uri": "237986517", "url":

If you're new to the site, you may want to subscribe to the the feed.\n\nStudies show that if Santa brought you a cell phone for Christmas this year, it was most likely an Apple product. Of course, with the recent release of the iPhone 6 and the first ever iPhone phablet, the 6 Plus, I suppose it shouldn't be surprising that holiday shoppers flocked to Tim Cook's doorstep to complete their shopping lists. Apple probably has one of the most dedicated followings of any tech company in the market today, and it certainly shows.\n\nFlurry, an analytics company headed by Yahoo! released a report based on activations and new app downloads from December 19 - 25, and as it turns out, Apple won by a landslide. Here's the graph:\n\nWith 51.3% of all smartphone activations, Apple was the top with Samsung trailing behind at just 17.7%. Nokia managed tos crape up 5.8% through their Lumia devices, and the other manufacturers are even further behind. So, to put that even more in perspective: for every Samsung device that was activated this holiday season, Apple activated 2.9 devices. For every Microsoft Lumia device, Apple activated 8.8 devices.\n\nIt should be noted, of course, that December 25 is not a major shopping season in China, where huge companies like Xaomi and Huawei are extremely popular and normally can give Apple a run for its money. From what I understand, these graphs are really only for the United States. Still, it's pretty impressive. I might not be much of an Apple fan, but apparently I'm in the minority there.", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "wgt": 3, "time": "15:28:00", "uri": "237987304", "url": "http://www.prepaidreviews.com/blog/iphone/apple-owned-holiday-smartphone-market-0101/", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Apple Owned Holiday Smartphone Market"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "16038", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17433", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"id": "17495", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile operating system"}}, {"id": "18090", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"id": "22373", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subreddit"}}, {"id": "28004", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"id": "31652", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"id": "41552", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"id": "717886", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Powerstar Golf"}}, {"id": "720088", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows Phone"}}, {"id": "852469", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_SmartGlass", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xbox SmartGlass"}}], "categories": [{"id": 70, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 486, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 1364, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Configuration Management", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Configuration_Management", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25499834", "source": {"id": "11319", "uri": "www.neowin.net", "title": "Neowin"}, "eventUri": "eng-1245403", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "A newly discovered bug in Microsoft's operating systems is causing the Xbox One SmartGlass app to crash and show wrong timestamps for messages.\n\nIt seems Microsoft did not expect the world to see the year 2015 as the message timestamps on its mobile operating system are showing the year as 31 December 2013 bringing back memories of the recent Twitter fiasco.

Because after nearly 20 years of helping Netizens navigate the Web, your favorite browser is about to be replaced. And no, I'm not talking about Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) Chrome, even though it did overtake Internet Explorer earlier this year for the first time as the United States' most popular Web browser.\n\nInstead, according to a report from ZDNet, Microsoft Corporation is readying its own replacement for its flagship browser starting with Windows 10. Codenamed \"Spartan,\" ZDNet's sources say the new browser definitely isn't just the next build of IE. Rather, Spartan is being built as a revamped, lightweight, extension-enabled browser that happens to sport a more similar look and feel to both Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. And while IE 11 might temporarily be available for backward compatibility purposes in Windows 10, more than anything it sounds like Spartan could end up being everything IE isn't -- or at least everything frustrated IE users have grown to believe it isn't.\n\nThe question of rebranding or renaming Internet Explorer arose back in August, when a group of engineers from Microsoft's IE team decided to tackle a Reddit AMA (\"Ask Me Anything\") forum. One Microsoft engineer responded that the topic had been discussed internally, and then elaborated, \"Plenty of ideas get kicked around about how we can separate ourselves from negative perceptions that no longer reflect our product today.\"\n\nBut why did Microsoft choose the complete replacement route? It's obviously the more laborious path, but it's also tremendously difficult for any company -- no matter how deep its pockets -- to positively reshape consumers' negative perceptions of a firmly entrenched product like IE. In Microsoft's case, those difficulties are almost certainly becoming more evident with each passing day as speed-oriented competitors like Chrome continue to take market share:\n\nU.S. Browser share, desktop + mobile, Credit: Adobe Digital Index\n\nFor perspective, that chart depicts the latest research from Adobe Digital Index this past April, where Chrome's 31.8% overall market share in the U.S. led the pack. Meanwhile, IE trailed close behind at 30.9%, followed by Apple's Safari at 25%.\n\nOf course, it doesn't help that Chrome and Safari are firmly embedded in hundreds of millions of Android and iOS devices, giving them impressive 20.3% and 59.1% respective shares among U.S. mobile devices. By comparison, IE controlled just 1.8% of the U.S. mobile market. Where Chrome makes up significant ground, however, is by rounding things out with its 30.6% share of desktop browsing in the U.S., compared with 43.3% for IE and just 10.3% for Safari.\n\nAs a result, while Microsoft may not be able to do much to stem the rise of Google or Apple in the mobile realm, you can bet it would love to maintain its desktop dominance going forward with the help of Spartan.\n\nWhether that's possible given Google's momentum remains to be seen. But for now, it's quite possible Microsoft could give us our first look at Spartan during its Jan. 21 Windows 10 reveal event, which the company has previously said will focus on the \"Windows 10 consumer experience.\"\n\nStill, ZDNet notes that may not happen if Spartan's code isn't quite ready for a primetime demo. But be sure to make a mental note if it does, because the rise of Spartan will mean the fall of Internet Explorer, which would mark the end of an era for the World Wide Web.", "sim": 0.6549019813537598, "wgt": 3, "time": "15:36:00", "uri": "237988296", "url": "http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/01/01/can-microsoft-spartan-beat-google-chrome-at-its-ow.aspx", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Microsoft Corporation Is About to Abandon Internet Explorer"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "15777", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"id": "15789", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17479", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"id": "17491", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"id": "17506", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"id": "18818", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"id": "19970", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"id": "24366", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"id": "31000", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer electronics"}}, {"id": "41552", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"id": "460904", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"id": "741230", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iOS_devices", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of iOS devices"}}], "categories": [{"id": 331, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 337, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 338, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 342, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 960, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 1108, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Digital Portable Players", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Digital_Portable_Players", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25500189", "source": {"id": "952", "uri": "www.fool.com", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "eventUri": "eng-1226338", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "\"While, the holidays in general and Christmas in particular are not the sole indicator of the smartphone market share and trends,\" said Jarah Euston, Flurry's vice president for analytics and marketing, in a post outlining new data on new mobile device activations, \"it is safe to say that Apple's newly released iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have had a blockbuster holiday season, despite a lackluster holiday season for the consumer electronics industry.\"\n\nFlurry's confidence in Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone line this holiday season stems from its findings that the company accounted for the lion's share of new mobile device activations from Dec. 19 to Dec. 25.The report on mobile device activations, based on data from more than 600,000 apps using Flurry analytics, reinforces the Street's bullish outlook for Apple's iPhone sales at the end of the year.\n\niPhone 6. Image source: Apple.\n\nSanta loves Apple\n\n\"More likely than not, Santa brought an Apple device,\" Euston said. During the week leading up to and including Christmas, Apple mobile devices accounted for 51% of new device activations worldwide, according to Flurry. Second place Samsung trailed far behind with an 18% share of new device activations.\n\n\"To put this in perspective, for every Samsung devices that was activated, Apple activated 2.9 devices. For every Microsoft Lumia device activated, Apple activated 8.8 devices,\" Euston explained.\n\nAnd Flurry's data is solid: When Flurry released a similar study in 2012, the analytics company said it detected over 90% of all new iOS and Android devices activated each day. With the number of apps using Flurry analytics more than doubling since then, I'd presume the fresh app data provides an even more accurate measure of device activation today than it did in 2012.\n\nFlurry cited the iPhone 6 line, which offers two phones with larger displays than previous iPhone models, as the key reason for Apple's big week. The growing popularity of smartphones with larger displays, Flurry said, likely served as a key catalyst for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus during the holiday week.\n\niPhone 6. Image source: Apple.\n\nA hot-selling iPhone means big money for Apple\n\nThe iPhone accounts for 56% of Apple's sales. And with Apple expected to report record iPhone sales in its fiscal first quarter, the tech giant's iPhone segment will likely account for more company revenue than ever before.\n\nFlurry's report isn't the only data pointing to a big quarter for Apple's iPhone. KGI Securities' well-connected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimated that first-quarter iPhone sales could soar 40% compared to the year-ago quarter. Furthermore, a survey by UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in November suggested there would be a high level of Android switchers, thanks to the appeal for the iPhone 6 line.\n\nAnalysts, on average, expect Apple to report record earnings per share of $2.54 during for the first quarter, up 23% from the year-ago quarter. While much of this rise will be attributable to Apple's share repurchases over the past 12 months, analysts also expect record iPhone sales to play a key role in driving the financial results.

Though the two tech behemoths play in slightly different sandboxes, they have a lot in common, some of it good, some of it not so good.\n\nBoth Microsoft and Intel lagged their peers prior to 2014 due to their slow transition to cutting edge technologies, including mobile and cloud solutions. But that was then, and 2015 is now. Investors have reveled in Microsoft's nearly 26% jump in share price in 2014, along with Intel's 41% pop. Now the question is what each will do for an encore. With clearly defined paths, and outstanding dividend yields relative to their peers, Microsoft and Intel are each primed for yet another impressive year. But which offers the most upside? It's a close call, but one holds a slight edge for investors in search of appreciation and dividend income along the way.\n\nThe case for Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft remains the king of software, and that's certainly not going to change any time soon. What has changed since the departure of former CEO Steve Ballmer is Microsoft's strategic focus, best described by new chief Satya Nadella's \"mobile-first, cloud-first\" mantra. Ballmer, to his credit, readily admitted he was slow in shifting Microsoft's focus on PC-related software and solutions to mobile and cloud technologies, and shareholders paid the price.\n\nNow Microsoft's transition, while not complete, is gaining traction by the day. With each successive quarter, Microsoft distances itself from the cloud competition. In its most recent fiscal 2015 Q1, Nadella once again announced triple-digit growth in cloud-related revenues, and there's no reason to think that won't continue when Microsoft announces fiscal Q2 results on Jan 26. Microsoft's impressive cloud-related financial performance wasn't the sole reason behind its 25% jump in quarterly revenues, but it certainly played a role.\n\nAs for mobile, Nadella's made it clear his plans go well beyond devices. The new Surface Pro 3 pseudo-tablet looks like a winner -- don't be surprised by stellar holiday sales results -- and Microsoft's emphasis on entry-level, low-cost phones in emerging markets is a sound strategy. But those are just the tip of Microsoft's mobile iceberg.\n\nNadella's introduction of Office 365 for iOS was more than a potential boon for software sales; it essentially ushered in a new mobile era for Microsoft. Since then, Microsoft has taken the wraps off an Office 365 version for Android, introduced its latest Visual Studio dev solution with Android-compatible development capabilities and a new mobile streaming solution for gamers, and opened the doors of its primary software platform .NET, making it open source and cross-platform.\n\nDon't discount Intel\n\nWhen Intel CEO Brian Krzanich was tapped as Paul Otellini's replacement he faced the same conundrum as Microsoft: moving the PC-reliant chip king into new markets, primarily cloud, mobile, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Like Ballmer, Otellini shouldered the blame for moving too slowly to an emphasis on cloud and related solutions, and Intel's stock floundered.\n\nBut coming off a record-breaking Q3 in which Intel generated revenue of $14.6 billion, a 30% jump in operating income, and upped gross margins from last year's 62.4% to its most recent quarter's impressive 65%, Krzanich has Intel hitting on all cylinders. How? Much of Intel's improvement is due to its dominant position supplying chips and related solutions to cloud-based data centers. Intel's Data Center Group generated about 25% of total revenue, increasing 16% compared to 2013's Q3.\n\nEstablishing itself as the data center chip supplier of choice in what IDC predicts will become a $127 billion market by 2018 bodes well for Intel, in 2015 and beyond. IoT, another market expected to explode, accounted for $530 million in revenue last quarter -- and while that may seem paltry relative to Intel's total sales, a 14% pop in sales, which Intel's IoT division accomplished, is nothing to sneeze at, particularly as the market as a whole is in its infancy.\n\nAs for income, both Intel and Microsoft are near the top compared to their tech brethren. Intel's balance sheet doesn't compare to Microsoft's, but with over $12.5 billion in cash and equivalents, its 2.45% dividend yield is certainly not in jeopardy. Nor is Microsoft's 2.63% dividend yield, considering it's sitting on over $89 billion in ready cash.\n\nBoth Intel and Microsoft have found their footing, and investors are right to expect continued price appreciation. Coupled with their strong dividend yields, it's nearly a toss-up as to which offers the most growth and income potential in 2015. But Microsoft, in addition to its slightly higher dividend, is a bit further along in its strategic transition than Intel, giving Nadella and team the edge in the New Year.", "sim":

comprised 24/7 Wall St.'s \"America's Worst Run Companies\", IBM (IBM:NYSE) was chosen as the worst among them. Our original list was published on December 16. Since then, IBM has made arguments that harsh criticisms of its operations are inaccurate. However, there have been several negative evaluations of IBM's management recently, particularly one published by Bloomberg two days ago.\n\nWhat makes a company truly poorly run? Businesses make mistakes almost daily, and industries can transform rapidly, eroding even a market leader's competitive advantage.\n\nCompanies that are struggling may have declining fundamentals, such as revenues and earnings. Ultimately, however, it is the market that determines how well, or poorly, a company is run. All of the eight businesses identified by 24/7 Wall St. as America's worst run companies declined in three key measures -- earnings per share, revenue, and share price -- in the last year. The exception is Staples, which has since been rumored to be taken over by outside investors since our list was published\n\nIn order to be considered truly poorly run, a company must have a track record of missed opportunities, mismanaged risks, poor operational decisions, or executive malfeasance. In short, a company must demonstrate a pattern of decision-making that calls into question the ability of its management and directors to adequately provide returns to shareholders.\n\nWhile the U.S. stock market has enjoyed a rally in the past five years, the worst run companies reviewed by 24/7 Wall St. failed to match the S&P 500 rise of 82% during that time. Some of these companies have actually lost market value over that stretch. Avon Products (NYSE: AVP) is the most notable example. Avon's share price tumbled nearly 74% over the last five years, as its China business transformed from a huge growth opportunity into a boondoggle.\n\nSome of the poorly managed companies have missed opportunities on which others capitalized. Among the best examples is McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), which did not follow fast-casual rivals in creating a menu that was simplified and customizable. GameStop (NYSE: GME), too, missed a major opportunity to make a name for itself in digital distribution for video games, a market that game maker Valve entered over a decade ago when it launched Steam.\n\nIn other instances, companies have made poor operational decisions. An example is the slow pace at which Staples (NASDAQ: SPLS) has closed locations. Staples built an online business without adequately downsizing its brick-and-mortar locations, even though sales did not justify the large number of stores.\n\nIn some cases, management decisions may not have had shareholders' best interests at heart. Freeport-McMoRan's (NYSE: FCX) acquisition of two oil producers in 2012 immediately raised questions of self-dealing and led to a shareholder lawsuit. The lawsuit alleged that, with six board members holding seats on one of the companies involved, Freeport directors were effectively using company funds to bail out their own investment.\n\nMany of these companies are not without hope. McDonald's could outperform if it is able to again draw in customers with an improved menu. Mattel (NYSE: MAT), too, might surge if kids rediscover the appeal of Barbie, or if it creates a successful new line of toys. And, IBM may be revived if the company becomes more competitive in cloud computing.\n\nIn order to determine America's worst run companies, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed all S&P 500 stocks that declined in the past year. We then screened for companies where the trailing 12-month revenue and diluted earnings per share had declined from the year before. 24/7 Wall St. editors then reviewed this list for companies that had missed major opportunities to expand, made operational choices that undermined their financial performance over a multi-year period, or whose managers and directors failed to adequately serve shareholder interests. Figures on revenue and diluted EPS, as well as industry classifications, are from S&P CapIQ. One-year share price data, also from CapIQ, is as of December 31, 2014.\n\nThese are America's Worst Run Companies, with IBM as the worst among them.\n\n1. International Business Machines\n\n> Industry: IT consulting and other services\n\n> Revenue (last 12 months): $97.4 billion\n\n> 1-year share price change: -14%\n\nIBM, which continues to be a market leader in IT consulting and hardware, has struggled to respond to the shift to cloud computing, as businesses moved from maintaining servers and mainframes to using cloud storage and software. While IBM continues to rely heavily on its legacy businesses, competitors, including Amazon and Rackspace, are well ahead in providing cloud infrastructure services.\n\nIn the first three-quarters of the year, revenues of the company's hardware unit declined by 16%, and the unit's profitability has continued to erode -- its pretax loss grew to $354 million. And although IBM's cloud computing sales are expanding rapidly, the company's annualized $3.1 billion in cloud services revenue are a fraction of its nearly $100 billion in total revenues.\n\nThe struggling hardware business hurts IBM's other segments, because the company's units are often dependent on each other -- hardware is often sold with software and services attached to it, for instance. IBM's global services external revenue declined by 2.7% in the third quarter from the same time a year ago.\n\nOne of the company's biggest problems in recent years was also largely self-induced -- IBM wanted to simultaneously grow the lower margin cloud business and raise adjusted earnings to $20 per share by 2015. Following the company's recent poor quarter, however, IBM said it would ditch that goal.\n\nBloomberg recently ran a brutal assessment of IBM entitled \"Five Charts Show Why IBM Is Worst Dow Performer for Second Year \". Among the author's criticisms:\n\nSince Ginni Rometty became chief executive officer in January of 2012, the shares have fallen 16 percent -- 14 percent of that this year alone. Investors have dumped the stock as Rometty struggles to re-imagine International Business Machines Corp. as a contender in cloud computing, data analytics and mobile technology. So far, those new areas haven't made up for a decline in sales of legacy hardware and technology consulting services.\n\nEditor's Note: IBM's PR department sent 24/7 Wall St. a note in reaction of our analysis. Among the comments:\n\nInstead you might want to consider that those strategic parts of IBM -- cloud, business analytics, social, mobile and security -- are up double digits YTD. These are the areas where IBM continues to invest aggressively because they are the emrging areas of IT that matter most to clients.\n\n2. McDonald's\n\n> Industry: Restaurants\n\n> Revenue (last 12 months): $28.0 billion\n\n> 1-year share price change: -3%\n\nFor decades, McDonald's was the model for how to build a global fast food brand. Recently, however, the company has been struggling. In November, the company announced that global comparable sales fell 2.2% year-over-year. In the United States, top-line performance was even worse, with comparable sales down 4.6%.\n\nOne regularly cited problem for McDonald's is young customers increasingly favoring fast-casual brands such as Chipotle and Panera Bread. These chains offer fresher food and straightforward, yet highly-customizable, menus. Notably, McDonald's once owned Chipotle before spinning off the brand in 2006.\n\nRecently, McDonald's announced plans to pare down its menu in order to address frequent criticism that it is too complex. However, investors may want to ask why McDonald's did not take action sooner, especially since in early 2014, executives at McDonald's admitted that \"we over-complicated the restaurants.\"\n\n3. Staples\n\n> Industry: Specialty supplies\n\n> Revenue (last 12 months): $22.7 billion\n\n> 1-year share price change: +16%%\n\nStaples appears to be making the transition from a brick-and-mortar chain to an online retailer. The company has been closing stores across the country to reduce their drag on earnings, which fell 13% over the last three years on a trailing 12 month basis. Staples announced at the start of the year plans to cut just over a 10th of its stores, or 225 in all, by the end of fiscal 2015.\n\nAlthough online sales have increasingly made up a larger portion of the company's revenues, shareholders would like to see an even faster pace of store closures.\n\nAnother problem is that Staples also faces fierce competition from huge retailers such as Amazon.com and Walmart. Recently, activist fund Starboard Value disclosed a major stake in Staples and in rival Office Depot. The fund is expected to push for the two to merge -- a move that could be in the company's best interest. Office Depot itself merged with rival OfficeMax last year and continues to close stores at a rapid pace.\n\n(There have been rumors that Staple's might be taken over by outside investors)\n\n4. GameStop\n\n> Industry: Computer and electronics retail\n\n> Revenue (last 12 months): $9.5 billion\n\n> 1-year share price change: -32%\n\nGameStop's efforts to break into the digital distribution space, which increasingly drives game sales, have not been successful. Much of this was likely due to the increased use of digital stores available on Microsoft and Sony's consoles, which allow customers to buy games without buying a physical copy.\n\nThe development of digital stores may also hit GameStop's highly profitable video game resale business, as customers increasingly use streaming services rather than buy physical discs. The emergence of Walmart's used game program is also a threat.\n\nGamestop has also been unable to build a successful service like Valve's Steam, a digital distribution platform for PC games. Valve has developed an enormously popular service, boasting 35 million active users as \"the world's largest online gaming platform,\" according to the company.\n\nGameStop's sales in the most recent quarter were down from the year before, as new software sales declined by more than a third. This is despite the fact that hardware sales received a boost from the November 2013 launch of the Xbox One and PlayStation 4.\n\n5. Mattel\n\n> Industry: Leisure products\n\n> Revenue (last 12 months): $6.1 billion\n\n> 1-year share price change: -35%\n\nMattel created the iconic Barbie over five decades ago. But while Barbie was once key to the company's success, in 2014 the doll has become its albatross. Gross sales of Barbie were down 21% in the third quarter from the third quarter the year before. This was even worse than in the preceding two quarters, when Barbie sales fell 14% and 15% in the first and second quarters, respectively.\n\nDespite the trend, Mattel has expressed its faith in the brand. CEO Brian Stockton told analysts in a recent earnings call that \"Barbie is going to continue to be a brand that we spend a lot of time and attention on.\" While the company is doubling-down on a flagging brand, it will soon lose the rights to a soaring one. Production of Disney Princess toys will shift to Hasbro in 2016, including for the hugely popular film, Frozen. Disney toys and Frozen helped offset some of Mattel's pain from the Barbie slump. According to the National Retail Federation, Frozen merchandise is set to surpass Barbie as the number one gift for girls this holiday season.\n\nAdditionally, Mattel has to compete with a resurgent Lego, which serves as evidence that reviving an established brand is possible in the current toy market. The Danish toymaker's revenues have soared in recent years. Lego reported 11% revenue growth in its most recent half year.\n\n6. Avon\n\n> Industry: Personal products\n\n> Revenue (last 12 months): $9.2 billion\n\n> 1-year share price change: -45%\n\nAvon, which was founded in 1886, offered women the opportunity to earn money long before many workplaces considered hiring women.\n\nAlthough the beauty products company has grown to a powerhouse, it has struggled in recent years. Avon replaced longtime CEO Andrea Jung with Johnson & Johnson's Sherilyn McCoy in 2012. The board charged McCoy with reversing years of declining profits and reaching a conclusion to the government's investigation into bribery allegations in China.\n\nIn December, nearly two and half years after McCoy was hired, the company agreed to resolve the bribery probe through settlements with both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. While the company once viewed China as a potential billion dollar market, its recent experiences there have been disastrous. Chinese sales cratered last year, dropping by 42% year-over-year, yet the company continues to invest on advertising in the market to back product re-launches.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, McCoy has been unable to restore the company to profitability. McCoy has been largely unable to stem a sales decline in the United States. North American revenues dropped 16% year-over-year in the third quarter, in large part due to a decrease in active independent Avon sales representatives. On a trailing 12-months basis, the company had a net loss of $123 million.\n\n7. Owens Illinois\n\n> Industry: Metal and glass containers\n\n> Revenue (last 12 months): $6.9 billion\n\n> 1-year share price change: -24%%\n\nOwens-Illinois (NYSE: OI) is a leader in glass packaging, including making bottles for beers, sodas, wines, and more. However, the company has been hit by hard times lately. O-I stands firmly in favor of glass packaging, but a lack of diversification is problematic since glass has lost market share to other types of packaging.\n\nOther packing companies have succeeded even as O-I has floundered. As O-I's earnings have fallen 24% in the last three years -- on a trailing 12 month basis -- metal packaging leader Ball Corporation's earnings have increased by 32% in that time, helped by a focus on containing costs. Barclay's noted in a recent downgrade that consumers no longer have strong preferences for glass bottles over cans -- at least not enough to justify the additional price.\n\nCompany investors may want also to question why the company has not expanded into metal. Privately held Irish company Ardagh Packaging Holdings Limited demonstrates that packaging companies can maintain operations in both metal and glass. Metal and glass each generated roughly half of the company's 4 billion euro revenue last year.\n\nO-I has done a consistently poor job of managing investor expectations. In October, Morningstar noted the company had a track record of setting overly optimistic forecasts that it fails to meet. The company lowered its guidance in October, leading to a selloff. In December, O-I again cut its 2015 outlook, prompting the Barclays downgrade. In a recent letter activist fund Atlantic Investment Management blamed management for inefficiently running the company, while calling CEO Albert Stroucken \"quick to assign blame to macro factors when earnings miss the target.\"\n\n8. Freeport-McMoRan\n\n> Industry: Diversified metals and mining\n\n> Revenue (last 12 months): $22.1 billion\n\n> 1-year share price change: -38%\n\nFreeport-McMoRan is a global mining company with copper, gold, molybdenum, and oil and gas operations. The company derives much of its operating profits from its North American copper business and from the Grasberg Minerals District in Indonesia, home to some of the world's largest copper and gold reserves. Like other commodities players, Freeport has been hurt by the drops in copper, gold, and oil prices.\n\nHowever, company investors have even more reasons to be upset. According to The Wall Street Journal, Freeport is closing in on a more-than $100 million lawsuit settlement related to the acquisitions of two companies in recent years. Shareholders alleged that Freeport's acquisition of a company called McMoRan Exploration, in which many Freeport executives held a stake, amounted to a bailout. They also alleged that its buyout of Plains Exploration & Production, a minority owner of McMoRan Exploration, was intended to ensure the first deal went through.\n\nMorningstar wrote in October that \"the deals constituted a major use of shareholder capital in a manner we believe was inconsistent with shareholder expectations,\" citing a 16% drop in stock price the day the deals were first announced.\n\nIn recent years, high pay packages for CEO Richard Adkerson have also been a source of criticism from investors. In the last five years, Freeport shares dropped by more than 44%, versus an 81% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nBy Douglas A.

Amazon.com in the US ahead of Christmas, with the top two spots going to Chromebooks made by Taiwan's top two computer makers Acer Inc (\u5b8f\u7881) and Asustek Computer Inc (\u83ef\u78a9).\n\nAccording to Amazon's listing based on sales from Nov. 1 to Dec. 19, the No. 1 seller was the 11.6-inch Acer C720 Chromebook, followed by the 13.3-inch Asustek Chromebook C300 and the 11.6-inch HP Chromebook 11.\n\nIn 2013, Chromebooks took two of the top three spots, with a Samsung Electronics Co model taking the top spot an Acer model ranking third.\n\nNew data from market intelligence firm ABI Research show that worldwide shipments of Chromebooks, which emphasize Internet connectivity more than traditional Windows-based computers, were forecast to reach 4.1 million units last year, almost double the 2.1 million units shipped in 2013.\n\nThe top three Chromebook vendors -- Acer, Samsung and Hewlett-Packard Co -- accounted for 74 percent of shipment share during first half of last year, ABI Research said.\n\nAccording to Digitimes Research's latest findings from the supply chain, Acer is set to launch a 15.6-inch Chromebook based on Intel Corp's Broadwell-U chip in March, while Dell Inc is planning to launch a 15.6-inch Chromebook with similar specifications in the first half of the year.\n\nThe two new larger and more powerful Chromebooks, which might be priced under US$300, are expected to be very competitive in the market, Digitimes Research said.\n\nHowever, Asustek might have made lower-than-expected shipments of its low-cost EeeBook laptop in the fourth quarter last year, due to competition from tablets and smartphones, Digitimes Research said.\n\nOnly about 200,000 units of the EeeBook X205 were shipped in the fourth quarter, the Taipei-based research firm said in a report issued on Tuesday.\n\nThe 11.6-inch clamshell notebook runs on Microsoft Corp's Windows with Bing operating system on an Intel chipset and is priced at US$199.\n\nDigitimes Research said that if the inexpensive product with limited functions is unable to find a new business model to boost sales, it might fail to compete with low-cost Chromebooks.\n\nAccording to statistics from Digitimes Research, Asustek's first Eee PC netbook was launched in the fourth quarter of 2007, and 700,000 units were shipped that quarter.\n\nAsustek's 10.1-inch Transformer Book T100 detachable 2-in-1 device, priced at US$260 on Amazon.com, was expected to see shipments of 400,000 units in the fourth quarter of last year, the data showed.\n\n\"Compared to them, the EeeBook X205's performance has been rather unsatisfactory,\" Digitimes Research senior analyst Joanne Chien (\u7c21\u4f69\u840d) said.\n\nWith the exception of display size, touchscreen features and exterior design, the X205 and T100 have similar specifications, with both featuring Intel's Atom Z3745 processor and 32GB internal storage capacity, Chien said.\n\nDespite similar performance and being 30 percent cheaper, the X205 has still been outperformed by the T100 in unit shipments, showing that the inexpensive low-specification traditional notebook is no longer able to attract consumers in a market that is filled with tablets and smartphones, she said.\n\nBy contrast, Acer's 11.6-inch Chromebook C720 -- last year's best-selling Chromebook, which sells at US$215 -- is expected to have shipped more than 400,000 units quarterly during the second half of last year, Chien added.", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "wgt": 2, "time":

global oil prices.\n\nEffective today, CPC cut the price per cubic meter of LNG by 12.58 percent on average from last month, saying that an average consumption of between 30m3 and 45m3 per month would mean savings of between NT$61.2 and NT$91.8 (US$1.93 and US$2.89) for each household, according to a press release.\n\nPrices for household LPG are to drop by NT$4.6 per kilogram and by NT$2.5 per liter for LPG used in cars, CPC said.\n\nAs a result, the price of a 20kg household gas cylinder would drop by NT$92, the company said.\n\nCentral bank auctions CDs\n\nThe central bank on Wednesday auctioned NT$120 billion in 364-day certificates of deposit (CDs), as it seeks to absorb excess funds in the market.\n\nThe auction yielded an average interest rate of 0.596 percent, the central bank said in a statement. That was lower than market expectations and declined for a third straight month.\n\nThe bank did not comment on the lower average yield in the latest 364-day CD sale.\n\nThe bank, which now has NT$1.64 trillion in outstanding 364-day CDs and two-year CDs, said its sale of such instruments was the equivalent of increasing the bank reserve requirement ratio by more than 5 percentage points.\n\nForeign interest boosts buys\n\nForeign institutional investors bought a net of more than NT$350 billion worth of local shares on the main board last year, according to statistics compiled by the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE).\n\nThe TWSE said that strong foreign institutional interest boosted the net buys to NT$354.63 billion last year, with the TAIEX rising 695.75 points or 8.08 percent from the previous year.\n\nAccumulated turnover on the main board during the 248 trading sessions last year totaled NT$23.42 trillion, rising 17.54 percent from the NT$19.60 trillion recorded in 2013, with average daily turnover of NT$92.91 billion, compared with NT$79.69 billion in 2013, TWSE said.\n\nGoogle receives green light\n\nThe Investment Commission on Wednesday said it had approved a proposal by Google Inc to add NT$2.1 billion to its investment in a data center in Changhua County.\n\nGoogle has invested US$600 million to set up a data center in an industrial park in the county.\n\nThe additional investment was made through Google affiliate Kohl Holdings Ltd, according to the commission.\n\nLast month, the Chinese-language Economic Daily News reported that the Google investment project might prompt Microsoft Corp to consider investing at least US$600 million to build a data center in the south this year.\n\nHTC may unveil new Desire\n\nSmartphone maker HTC Corp (\u5b8f\u9054\u96fb) might unveil a new model in its mid-tier Desire series at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada, between Sunday and next Friday.\n\nThe company published a teaser image on its Sina Weibo (\u65b0\u6d6a\u5fae\u535a) page on Tuesday that said a press event will take place on Sunday in Las Vegas, along with a tag line that reads: \"Always Desire more.\"\n\nHTC saw its sales bolstered last year by mid-range phones like the Desire 816 and Desire 820.

"beefmagazine.com", "title": "Beef magazine"}, "eventUri": "eng-1237278", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "What a year 2014 was; it's surely one that we'll talk about for generations. With that said, here is my take on what the beef industry's five biggest themes were in 2014. Do you agree?\n\n1. Record prices. Tight supplies and strong demand created an ongoing string of record prices in all cattle categories, as well as record profitability. What's more, this good fortune looks to continue into 2015 and beyond. No other industry story can approach this one in significance, and no story needs less description. The good news is that this is a story that is still being written.\n\n2. The beef checkoff is healthier than any of us thought. Despite the failure of leadership that threatened to destroy the checkoff just a few short years ago, producer support for the checkoff remains at near all-time highs. Meanwhile, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack's attempt to create a second checkoff failed, which illustrated that while the current checkoff may not be perfect, it's a pretty good system. When Vilsack rolled out the idea of a second checkoff, people realized what was really needed is the current checkoff, but with more dollars to invest and less government oversight.\n\n3. Mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL). COOL increasingly looks like a great waste of industry resources. We fought battles within the industry, and we've brought down the wrath of the World Trade Organization on us as well. It was never a battle worth waging. The impact of COOL was minimal, the death of it inevitable, and the expenditure of so much industry effort simply worthless.\n\nThe leaders on both sides bear responsibility for this. We all were caught up in the ideology of this debate, which was significant, but the actual policy impact was not worth the political capital expended on either side. Never has an issue captured so much attention, time and money, and had so little impact. It is fitting that it is going out with a whimper, because it never amounted to much more than that.\n\n4. The real industry threats are in Washington, D.C. Whether it's the regulatory interpretation of the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act or a host of other interactions between our industry and the federal regulatory apparatus, some of our biggest challenges continue to reside in our nation's capital. The government continues to be a key determinant of profitability for many industries, increasingly deciding who the winners and losers will be within those industries.\n\nHow big of a factor is this in our business? Consider that cattlemen in highly regulated states like California and Florida were the first to begin creating budget items for lawyers and for supporting their cattlemen's associations. That's because they understood early on that their survival depended on going head-to-head with overzealous environmental interests. Today, that realization extends to every state in the union. With fewer folks involved in ranching, we must better support and utilize our state and national organizations to fight for our interests and future.\n\n5. Profitability actually sparks innovation. A commodity mindset has always been revered in our industry. In a low-margin, capital-intensive, commodity-priced business model, it's the low-cost producers who survive. We've been taught to squeeze a dime out of a nickel, and analyze any investment with a very sharp pencil. It was a necessity, but the industry is now learning that it also greatly limited innovation.\n\nAs profits have increased and dollars flowing within the industry grow, so is innovation. We're now investing in the future and making dramatic changes. We now understand how companies like Apple or Microsoft have been able to do so many innovative things. Innovation is much easier when accompanied by profits.", "sim": 0.2980392277240753, "wgt": 2, "time": "17:26:00", "uri": "237999904", "url": "http://beefmagazine.com/blog/5-biggest-themes-us-cattle-industry-2014", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "5 biggest themes for the U.S. cattle industry in 2014"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "15628", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information"}}, {"id": "15666", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Website"}}, {"id": "16038", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"id": "16056", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook.com"}}, {"id": "16323", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Wide Web"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17337", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Database"}}, {"id": "17438", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"id": "17442", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"id": "17477", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "System"}}, {"id": "17487", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Client (computing)"}}, {"id": "18686", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"id": "19812", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"id": "19967", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Application programming interface"}}, {"id": "20454", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"id": "22264", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"id": "25334", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Function (mathematics)"}}, {"id": "27706", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"id": "34786", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Network socket"}}, {"id": "35946", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web page"}}, {"id": "37401", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power station"}}, {"id": "38593", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peer-to-peer"}}, {"id": "38594", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domain name"}}, {"id": "40359", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JSON"}}, {"id": "71874", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WebKitGTK+"}}], "categories": [{"id": 70, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 128, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 442, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 539, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25504592", "source": {"id": "988", "uri": "www.prlog.org", "title": "PRLOG (Press Release Distribution)"}, "eventUri": "eng-1238515", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "PRLog - Jan. 1, 2015 - KENSINGTON, U.K. -- As Microsoft announced that they are building a new lightweight web browser this week, we at DigitalZombie Ltd. decided that it is time to rattle the cage of the otherwise peaceful existence of all web browsers with something really new.\n\nHydrogen Web Browser completely rethinks the web experience as a whole. With the possibility to search for you, integrated AI, new UI, tremendously better navigation, second search, it provides a completely new way to store and represent Favorites and History items.\n\nSneak Peak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3YiyiaYsCY\n\nHow it is supposed to search for me? Isn't that too far ahead in the future?\n\nThe Hydrogen Browser learns from you, analyzes how you are using it. On this particular basis it is able to suggest new ways of finding and organizing information which does not mean that Hydrogen Browser is something like Big Brother. It means that you can control and manage the perpetual searches and exactly what to observe. It can search the web 24/7 for new information based on your criteria.\n\nSo far Favorites was a somewhat side functionality of a browser and never organized very well.\n\nSo we decided to change that.\n\nFavorites search is full of features and is very easy to use.\n\nYou have filters which include sort favorites by topic, date, domain, color tag, text tag and a function that is showing you how many times you have visited the link.\n\nThe search in Favorites section is awesome. It gives you the opportunity to search not only by title or domain name, but the full text of the webpage as well.\n\nWhen you add the favorite the browser gets the whole text from the webpage and writes it together with the favorite.\n\nSo if you are looking for something in your Favorites but you cannot remember where it was or what was the name of the website, now you have an easy way to find it .\n\nHydrogen Browser is far more than a pretty user interface. It is a developer powerhouse. Below we will some of the developer features:\n\nWebKit based\n\nIntegrated audio/video streaming server.\n\nIntegrated support of NodeJS modules loaded on the client system.\n\nPer domain/subdomain NOSQL database on the client machine.\n\nDeep learning subsystem\n\nSSH client.\n\nJSON Viewer/Editor + Request tester.\n\nPeer to Peer with DHT support subsystem.\n\nSockets support through the NodeJS subsystem.\n\nAnd much more.... Accessible through the browser API.\n\nThe first developer preview version will be available in mid December 2015.\n\nHydrogen Browser is a product of DigitalZombie Ltd. We have more than 15 years of experience in Desktop and Mobile development.\n\nYou can find us on: http://www.digitalzombie.co and http://www.hydrobrowser.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HydroBrowser\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/HydroBrowser\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/hydrogen-browser", "sim": 0.4901960790157318, "wgt": 2, "time": "17:44:00", "uri": "238002064", "url": "http://www.prlog.org/12410224-hydrogen-web-browser-the-first-web-browser-with-integrated-artificial-intelligence.html", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Hydrogen Web Browser - The first web browser with integrated Artificial Intelligence"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": ["238023366"], "concepts": [{"id": "15666", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Website"}}, {"id": "15669", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"id": "16323", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Wide Web"}}, {"id": "16635", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17433", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"id": "18090", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"id": "22373", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subreddit"}}, {"id": "27706", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"id": "28531", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerworld", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computerworld"}}, {"id": "31652", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"id": "38587", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firefox"}}, {"id": "38717", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet Explorer"}}, {"id": "45499", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"id": "45577", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"id": "48414", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 7"}}, {"id": "69236", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZDNet", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ZDNet"}}, {"id": "74296", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser_engine", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web browser engine"}}, {"id": "74310", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neowin", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neowin"}}, {"id": "78090", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Backward compatibility"}}, {"id": "98931", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intranet"}}, {"id": "129739", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(layout_engine)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trident (layout engine)"}}, {"id": "718251", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows 8"}}, {"id": "841205", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Applications", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net Applications"}}, {"id": "856276", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_10", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet Explorer 10"}}], "categories": [{"id": 70, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 442, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25504985", "source": {"id": "1407", "uri": "www.computerworld.com.au", "title": "Computerworld"}, "eventUri": "eng-1246570", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Microsoft will unveil a browser not named Internet Explorer alongside Windows 10. Here's what Microsoft may have in mind.\n\nMicrosoft will unveil a browser not named Internet Explorer (IE) alongside Windows 10, according to an online report.\n\nLong-time Microsoft watcher and ZDNet blogger Mary Jo Foley cited unnamed sources on Monday to say that the browser would be separate from the existing IE, would sport a minimalist user interface (UI), and would support extensions, sometimes called add-ons, much like Google's Chrome and Mozilla's Firefox.\n\nSeparately, Neowin claimed that Microsoft has forked its Trident browser rendering engine to create a more lightweight version that would be called when IE encounters a modern site, one that doesn't require support for older IE standards. In Neowin's scenario, there would not be two different browser UIs; the use of the streamlined Trident engine -- or the existing, backwards-compatible version -- would be automatic and invisible to the user of what the publication thought would be eventually dubbed IE12.\n\nMeanwhile, Foley said that the new browser -- code named \"Spartan\" -- will be included with Windows 10, perhaps as the default, but will also be accompanied by a refreshed IE11. The latter will be offered for those who need backwards compatibility with older websites and more importantly, older Web apps.\n\nA name other than IE for the new browser would not be a surprise: In August Microsoft hinted that it was thinking of just that. \"The discussion I recall seeing was a very recent one [just a few weeks ago]. Who knows what the future holds?\" teased Jonathan Sampson of Microsoft in a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" online discussion, while answering a question about a name change to distance the browser from lingering negative perceptions.\n\nIn the end, it may not matter whether Microsoft forks the browser into two separate applications or just forks the Trident engine. The result would be the same: One browser/engine that goes forward, another browser/engine that remains static as an option primarily for businesses, the customers who most require compatibility with older sites -- mainly their own intranet domains -- and older Web apps used by their employees.\n\nMicrosoft's strategy? To have a fresh start on browsers, and leave the cumbersome legacy support required of IE behind. The browser/engine of the future would be aggressively updated -- as will all of Windows -- while the browser/engine of the past would be maintained but not significantly enhanced.\n\nIf that's the idea, Microsoft's abrupt announcement in August that it was forcing users to upgrade to IE11 makes more sense in hindsight. Then, Microsoft told customers that after Jan. 12, 2016, only IE11 would be supported with security updates on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.\n\nPushing users toward IE11 could thus be seen as the first announced step -- necessary in 2014 to give customers, particularly conservative corporations, time to make the move -- in a broader plan to deemphasize that version as Microsoft prepared to unveil and aggressively promote a new browser or at least a new browser engine.\n\nAccording to analytics vendor Net Applications, IE11 accounted for 43% of all versions of IE run in November, making it the most-used edition.\n\nBy consolidating users on IE11, Microsoft not only reduces its own support costs -- fewer versions of IE to support -- but prepares customers for a future where only IE11 boasts the kind of backward compatibility necessary for enterprises.\n\nOther promises Microsoft made in August back that speculation, as it pledged that the legacy support tool introduced in April, \"Enterprise Mode for Internet Explorer 11,\" would be maintained, improved and supported on Windows 7 through its retirement date of January 14, 2020. By continuing to maintain Enterprise Mode for IE11, Microsoft would be able to tell companies to standardize on that browser if they needed to support legacy websites and apps. Others would be able to move to the new browser -- if Foley is correct -- or use the new lighter-weight Trident engine, assuming Neowin is more on the mark.\n\nA brand new browser, however, would give Microsoft an advantage over offering two rendering engines within one named IE.\n\nHistorically, Microsoft has supported a version of IE until the end of support for the edition of Windows it ran on. Although that policy is now in tatters because of the January 2016 deadline -- IE10's support on Windows 7 was chopped by seven years with that decision -- a new, separate browser as Foley outlined would let Microsoft make even more radical moves.\n\nOther browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, are patched only in their latest versions. Because Google and Mozilla update their browsers every six to eight weeks, users must keep pace or risk running a vulnerable application.\n\nMicrosoft may want to follow in their footsteps: In fact, the FAQ dedicated to the January 2016 deadline noted rivals' practices as a reason for those changes. \"Focusing support on the latest version of Internet Explorer for a supported Windows operating system is in line with industry standards,\" the FAQ read (emphasis added).\n\nA newly-named browser would allow Microsoft to change its support policy for that application to match Chrome's and Firefox's. In other words, if Microsoft releases a browser named \"Spartan,\" it might tell customers that they need to run the latest update to receive patches, then update that browser every few weeks. (In 2014, Microsoft patched IE every month.)\n\nFor those unable to keep up, Microsoft could point them toward IE11 and its Enterprise Mode, which would presumably be provided with patches as usual. Customers would not need to be running only the latest IE11 update to receive more fixes.\n\nThat kind of browser split -- Spartan (or whatever name it's eventually given) on one hand, IE11 on the other -- would match how Microsoft will handle Windows 10: Consumers will receive automatic OS updates, probably monthly, in lieu of occasional upgrades, while businesses will be able to opt for one of two slower tempos.\n\nMore information about Microsoft's Jan. 12, 2016, deadline for upgrading to the newest browser for each version of Windows can be found on the company's website.\n\nMicrosoft has scheduled a press and analyst event for Jan. 21 in Redmond, where it will unveil the next iteration of the Windows 10 preview. That version will focus on consumer features, and may include the new browser or rendering engine.\n\nJoin the Computerworld newsletter!

"Since Windows Server 2012 introduced Storage Spaces, software-defined storage (SDS) has been moving up the stack: it's gone from an acceptable alternative to the kind of RAID systems you find in NAS boxes to competing with full-featured SANs using the Scale-Out File Server (SoFS) role on commodity servers and storage. The StorSimple appliances and Azure Storage services bridge the gap to iSCSI. And in Windows Server vNext you get more SAN features like storage quality-of-service and storage replication. At this point, you need a good reason to be picking a proprietary SAN, even for high-end storage.\n\nPooling your disks: Storage Spaces and tiers\n\nThe heart of Windows Server's storage tools is Storage Spaces, its built-in storage virtualisation tools. Storage virtualisation has long been the province of high-end storage arrays, like those from HP and EMC, but Windows Server brings its key features to the average departmental server, not just to the data centre.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you're using directly attached or network storage; as long as you're using a block-level protocol and have direct access to your disks, you can quickly build pools of storage that can be used to build virtualised storage -- either a fixed size or a thin-provisioned pool. You can create clustered pools, with failover, as well as standalone pools. Clustered pools are limited to 80 physical disks, as they need to handle failover between nodes, while you can have up to 240 disks in a standard pool, in four 60-disk JBODs.\n\nOnce pools are in place they can be configured as Storage Spaces. A high-level storage virtualisation service, Storage Spaces can configure sections of disk pools as either simple spaces, mirror spaces or parity spaces. Simple spaces are much like traditional disks, with no resilience, and are best used for temporary data -- think of them as scratch working storage. Mirror and parity spaces add resilience (especially when used with Microsoft's new ReFS file system). Mirrors are a powerful tool, and there's support for up to three-way mirroring, using enclosure awareness to associate data copies with specific JBODs. With three-way mirroring, and three or four JBODs you can lose an entire enclosure and still keep running.\n\nStorage Spaces can also improve performance, by using striping to store data across multiple disks. If you're mirroring data, this can improve performance considerably, allowing data not only to be retrieved from multiple disks in parallel, but also from multiple JBODs. To keep your system easy to maintain, you should standardise on one type of disk in a JBOD (and ideally one specific firmware release).\n\nMicrosoft uses Storage Spaces for one of its most demanding storage scenarios: the Windows release server, where it was able to significantly increase capacity and storage throughput at less than half the cost of the SAN it used to use.\n\nWhen you need more performance from your storage, Windows Server 2012 R2's built-in storage tiering is a powerful tool that takes advantage of hardware support in Storage Spaces to segregate SSD from HDD storage. Once set up, data is automatically tiered between SSD and HDD, with your most frequently used data stored on SSD for faster access. As data ages, it's automatically moved to HDD. There's no user intervention needed once you've set up your storage pool and defined the disks used for each tier -- you just need to be sure that you've used fixed provisioning for the storage pool.\n\nScaling out to a storage fabric\n\nAn important element of Microsoft's storage story is its SMB protocol, the heart of Windows file sharing. A new version, SMB 3.0, arrived with Windows Server 2012, adding support for many key software-defined storage requirements. These include support for transparent failover between clustered storage nodes, and direct access to network adapters for faster data transfer. There's also now support for end-to-end encryption, making it harder for your data to be intercepted while in motion. To get the most from the latest version, SMB 3.02, you're going to need make sure that you're using network cards that support RDMA access.\n\nThat's an important point: getting the most from any of Windows new storage features may mean investing in new hardware. That puts up the price, but it's commodity hardware that's still cheaper than buying a third-party system, and won't require additional storage management software.\n\nBring all the new Windows Server storage features together, and you've got the Scale-Out File Server. Using Windows clustering features, SoFs lets you share the same folder from all the nodes of a cluster -- with changes in any one instance replicated to the rest. As calls can be routed to any node, you get faster access to data on busy servers, as well as the ability to be running disk checks and other resource-intensive tasks on one node at a time, while the others carry on delivering data.\n\nScale-Out File Server is the logical endpoint of Windows Server 2012 R2's software-defined storage. It's fast, flexible, and cheaper than the SAN alternatives. It might not be for every network, but it's also something you can build up to, as you start to use Storage Spaces and then add clustering to your network. The end result is a storage fabric, much like that used by Azure -- and ready for your own private cloud. While it's not suitable for all workloads in this version (especially not SharePoint and other document-centric services), Scale-Out File Server is ideal for hosting virtual machine images and virtual hard disks, for handling databases and for hosting web content.\n\nTo the cloud\n\nMicrosoft's StorSimple appliances take a different approach to storage networking, offering massive amounts of storage while taking up very little physical space. That's because they're actually a mix of hardware and software, automatically tiering your least-used data onto Azure.\n\nThe latest StorSimple 8000 series hardware uses iSCSI to connect to your existing server, with a mix of SSD and HDD storage. As data moves down the tiers, it's automatically deduped, with the lowest-priority data transferred to cloud storage, with the option of up to 500TB stored in Azure blob storage. Local storage is what you'd expect from an iSCSI storage appliance -- with 40TB or so of available disk space (and more if your data can be deduplicated and compressed), but it behaves like an array that gets bigger without you having to buy more drives.\n\nThe real advantage of the latest StorSimple appliance is that it acts as a bridge between your on-premises storage and the cloud. An Azure-hosted StorSimple virtual appliance comes with your subscription, and is managed from the same Azure portal as your on-premises arrays. Data uploaded to Azure and managed with the StorSimple virtual appliance can be accessed by Azure IaaS VMs, for disaster recovery or as part of a cloud migration. You get storage that behaves like a SAN and a cloud service at the same time.\n\nTaking software-defined storage further\n\nWhen the next version of Windows Server comes out (probably in fall 2015), it will include even more software-defined storage tools (as well as using the next version of SMB, probably 3.11).\n\nEven the SoFS role is currently limited in terms of how far you could scale out. A new feature, Storage Replica does the kind of synchronous replication you'd use to keep two storage arrays continuously in sync with the guarantee that you don't lose data, but with more flexibility. You'd usually need to have software running on your cluster to have SAN replication do automatic failover when something goes wrong -- and you always need to think about the distances involved. Because if it's too far, the latency and delayed writes will slow down your applications too much to be practical. Plus you tend to need near-identical SAN setups for synchronous replication.\n\nStorage Replica works between almost any kind of storage -- including a laptop hard drive or a JBOD, server storage or your existing SAN -- using SMB 3.1 transport; it's volume based and runs at the block rather than file level (so it doesn't matter if files are in use).\n\nYou can use it for synchronous replication to get always in-sync, but if you need to stretch over a longer distance and you can cope with crash-consistent volumes and possible data loss, you can use the same system for asynchronous replication. That means you can stretch a cluster across two sites to get high availability and disaster recovery. Storage Replica even replicates volume snapshots. And it doesn't need complex infrastructure -- just Active Directory and at least 1Gbps networking between your servers, ideally with SSDs to store the logs. You can also use the new Cloud Witness feature to use Azure as the required vote for a cluster quorum that you need for a stretch cluster, instead of adding extra hardware.\n\nMicrosoft is also planning to add support for a Scale-out File Server role that works without shared storage, and lets you use direct attached SATA drives to save money. That would be ideal for storing virtual machines, backups and as a replica target,and again will use SMB 3 for the storage network fabric. With storage resiliency that manages transient disruptions to storage -- saving the state of a virtual machine and pausing it until the storage is working normally again -- you'll be able to run virtualised workloads on ever-cheaper storage hardware.\n\nWindows Server 2012 R2 added Storage Quality of Service (QoS) to Hyper-V, but in the next version it gets much more effective. The new algorithm is based on both Microsoft's experience managing storage in Azure and on research by MSR. Typically, QoS is based on network rate limits and workload classification, but it doesn't do well at helping you meet storage SLAs when you have the 'noisy neighbour' problem with one workload hogging shared storage. Microsoft is taking a new approach that assigns costs to storage operations based on the hardware, the workload, bandwidth and latency, and then dynamically partitions the storage traffic using a centralised controller to do a better job of making sure each virtual machine gets a fair share of storage bandwidth.\n\nIt works on Hyper-V and will be turned on by default for Scale-Out File Server workloads. You can set QoS policy for both IOPS and latency that applies to an individual VHD, to a VM, to a service or to a whole workload. That means you don't have to work out how to make demanding applications play well together; you can just set the maximum or minimum IOPS you need from your storage for a particular workload and Windows Server will automatically prioritise and throttle virtual machines as necessary to make sure you get it.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the problem VM is one you haven't set policy for; Windows Server will still manage it, to make sure you get the storage you need on the workloads you're protecting with policy. In the Technical Preview you use PowerShell for storage QoS; at launch, System Centre will also have tools for this. That means you can virtualise, distribute and protect your storage in the same system from which you're managing your virtual machines and workloads. Again, that's another advantage over a proprietary SAN, where you'll probably end up using dedicated storage management software as well as your other tools.\n\nWindows Server 2012 R2 is already a very capable replacement for many SAN scenarios, as well as making virtualised storage simple and cheap enough for small businesses. With the next version, it gets more sophisticated, for both on-premises and hybrid cloud storage options -- and you can still do it all on commodity hardware.", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "wgt": 3,

functions like the radio, ventilation, advanced safety systems and Internet services.\n\nLooking to simplify such cockpitlike controls, automakers are starting to take design cues from a familiar household gadget, the tablet computer.\n\nFord, for example, announced last month that it would adopt a new touch-screen, tablelike system to replace its much-criticized connected-car designs. It's a reflection of the radical transformation of vehicles as automakers wrestle with how to integrate smartphones and online services into cars without increasing driver distraction -- and frustration.\n\n\"We looked at what aspects of tablets made sense,\" said Don Butler, Ford's executive director for connected vehicles and services, referring to the Sync 3, the next generation of the company's in-dash system, which will appear in models this year. Ford plans to offer Sync 3 across its entire line in the United States by the end of 2016.\n\nIt's a marked shift for Ford, whose seven-year partnership with Microsoft produced several systems that were often criticized for being too complex and balky.\n\nThe new system will be based on software from QNX Software Systems, a Canadian company with extensive experience in the automotive sector. Even though QNX is owned by BlackBerry, Ford took its inspiration for Sync 3 not from the parent company's smartphones, but from Apple's iPad.\n\nBased on an eight-inch touch screen, Sync 3 uses fewer and larger icons that can be recognized at a glance. The touch-sensitive areas are bigger, and drivers can use more than one finger at a time, allowing for gestures like pinching to zoom in on a map. A bar along the bottom of the screen always displays primary functions like climate control, navigation and audio.\n\nBut moves that may be convenient for a tablet user lying on a couch can be deadly for drivers.\n\nTesla Model S owners, for example, can view a reverse camera angle of the car while driving forward, as well as view other information, all of it illuminated on a vast 17-inch touch screen.\n\n\"But the bigger size is better because it means the buttons can be larger,\" said Todd Lockwood, a Model S owner in South Burlington, Vt. Mr. Lockwood said he could adjust braking and suspension settings while driving, which is easier on the big screen.\n\nConversely, Cadillac has been criticized for its iPad-like CUE system, which has a touch-sensitive slider to adjust the volume. Ford endured similar disdain from many drivers over a touch-sensitive volume button in some MyLincoln Touch systems.\n\nTo Ford, the message was clear: The volume knob stays.\n\nMr. Butler said that Ford was sensitive to the problem of driver distraction. So some common gestures common in tablets and smartphones are not migrating to the dashboard.\n\n\"When you scroll through a list, the list continues to roll normally on a tablet, but that inertial spinning is not ideal for a vehicle environment,\" Mr. Butler said. That move will not be in Sync 3 so that drivers do not become mesmerized spinning playlists, for example.\n\nFord said that it was keeping an eye on voluntary guidelines set in 2013 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which recommend that any single interaction not take more than two seconds. In that time, a car can travel 176 feet at 60 miles an hour.\n\nOne of the most anticipated new touch-screen systems is coming from Volvo, which has made safety one of its biggest selling points. The centerpiece of its new XC90 sport utility vehicle, coming early this year, is a new connected-car system that has a nine-inch touch screen.\n\n\"Everybody's used to touch screens,\" said Thomas M\u00fcller, Volvo's vice president for electrical and electronic systems engineering. \"You see them in modern kitchens; simple laptops come with a touch screen. It's become mainstream and a normal thing to do.\"\n\nAs a result, there will be only eight buttons in the Volvo system, including what the industry calls hard controls for front and rear defrost, skip track, pause and a mandatory hazard warning light switch. And, yes, there is a large knob that can control the volume.\n\nMr. M\u00fcller argues that because consumers are so accustomed to touch interfaces, it's the safest design for connected-car systems, with some caveats. \"Interactions on the screen should not lead to misinterpretation,\" he said, \"because while driving it can be devastating.\"\n\nSo other ways of interacting with the system need to be deployed, like improved voice control. In the new Volvo system, drivers will be able to say, \"I'm cold,\" and the heat will come on, Mr. M\u00fcller said.\n\nOne of the most positively reviewed connected-car systems of the last year has been the Chrysler brand's Uconnect, another QNX-based system. It uses an 8.4-inch touch screen in its top-of-the-line system. The graphics look less like a tablet, but the controls are simple and unembellished.\n\n\"When customers see a large screen, they think it provides an opportunity to touch and control,\" said Joni Christensen, Chrysler's head of global marketing, Uconnect systems and services. But there are also hard or physical controls for heat and air-conditioning and voice recognition that can switch radio stations or get a weather report. \"It helps people adapt to the new technology at their own pace,\" she said.\n\nAndrew Poliak, global director of business development at QNX, said that different types of controls, like the volume knob, were needed for different tasks.\n\nNot all automakers are embracing touch screens, including Audi.\n\nAnupam Malhotra, Audi's senior manager for connected vehicles, said that rather than using a single iPad-like screen, multiple touch screens might be a better solution. (Audi is about to introduce its next-generation connected-car system, but would not say whether it will adopt a touch screen.)\n\nNevertheless, many automakers are clearly on a tablet track. What's less clear is how they will work with the companies behind those tablets. Nearly every car manufacturer insists it is working closely with Apple and Google, each of which will be promoting their own software CarPlay and Android Auto this year.\n\nWhile that happens, the tablet revolution rolls on.", "sim": 0.7843137383460999, "wgt": 2, "time": "18:21:00", "uri": "238005686", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/automobiles/to-tame-dashboard-chaos-carmakers-take-a-hint-from-tablets.html", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Carmakers Take a Hint From Tablets"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17433", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"id": "17479", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"id": "17492", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"id": "17801", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"id": "18090", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"id": "31652", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"id": "40362", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interface (computing)"}}, {"id": "41552", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"id": "203919", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brix", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brix"}}, {"id": "262075", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"id": "718251", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows 8"}}, {"id": "720088", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows Phone"}}, {"id": "722874", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Store", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Windows Store"}}], "categories": [{"id": 70, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 486, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 547, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 915, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25506067", "source": {"id": "5740", "uri": "www.myce.com", "title": "Myce.com"}, "eventUri": "eng-1245403", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Microsoft claims the amount of app downloads from the Windows Store has grown with 110 percent last year.

"body": "LONDON -- Europe's tax showdown could be headed straight to people's wallets.\n\nWith the new year, a change in fiscal rules in the European Union is increasing the tax on many purchases of digital content like e-books and smartphone applications.\n\nUnder the new rules, first approved in 2008, the tax rate on digital services like cloud storage and movie streaming will be determined by where consumers live, and not where the company selling the product has its European headquarters. Tax experts say Europe's revamped rules could add up to an extra $1 billion in annual tax revenue for European governments.\n\nWhat remains unclear is who in the 28-country bloc will pay most of the bill.\n\n\"There inevitably will be a price change,\" said Richard Mollet, chief executive of the Publishers Association, a British trade body. \"The question is whether retailers, publishers or customers will have to take on board any increase.\"\n\nThe changes to Europe's so-called value-added tax -- a tax on goods and services similar to sales taxes in the United States -- are part of a continuing push by lawmakers to tax the region's digital economy more heavily. Companies like Apple and Amazon have been roundly criticized for housing their European operations in low-tax countries like Ireland and Luxembourg. The companies say they operate there legally.\n\nMany of the world's largest tech companies selling digital products, like Amazon and Microsoft, now house their European digital businesses in Luxembourg, where the V.A.T. rate is as low as 3 percent for e-book purchases. In contrast, countries like Britain charge companies a 20 percent sales tax for selling e-books. Analysts say the current rules provide an advantage to global companies that have the financial muscle to shop around for the lowest tax rate.\n\nMicrosoft has said that charges for Skype, the Internet calling service, will increase for European consumers, as the company alters the V.A.T. levels in line with individual countries' tax rates. The European prices for Microsoft's other services, including game downloads, are not expected to change.\n\nNetflix, the video-streaming service that is expanding aggressively across Europe, does not plan to increase its monthly charge, and Amazon said that the cost of its annual Prime membership, which includes online video content in some countries, would not rise. An Amazon spokesman, however, declined to comment on whether the expected tax increase for e-books would be passed on to customers or if the company or publishers would eventually pick up additional costs.\n\n\"People will take their cue from Amazon,\" said Mr. Mollet of the Publishers Association, who added that the company's dominant position in Europe's e-book market gave it significant weight in setting pricing. \"In the first few weeks, we'll likely see a lot of price volatility.\"\n\nGoogle and Apple, which run the world's two largest app stores, will also not reduce the 30 percent cut that they take from each digital sale. The American tech giants, however, will collect each country's V.A.T. charge on behalf of app developers. Some of those are expected to absorb the tax increases to avoid angering European customers, who are unlikely to welcome any increase in the price of games, apps or other digital downloads.\n\n\"Everyone is going to face the same problem; it will be tough to raise prices,\" said Andy Payne, co-founder of Mastertronic Group, a small British video game publisher. \"Will the V.A.T. changes reduce our revenue? The answer is probably yes.\"\n\nEurope's efforts follow similar attempts in the United States to pass an Internet sales tax that would force online retailers to collect sales taxes for state and local governments, even if the companies do not have a physical presence in the state. Congress, however, has yet to pass such a bill.\n\nThe tax overhauls also come as policy makers on both sides of the Atlantic struggle to keep pace with technological advances. Since Europe's V.A.T. changes were approved in 2008, for example, companies like Netflix have significantly changed how they operate, moving to relying on Internet movie streaming that takes advantage of high-speed broadband and away from DVD rentals sent through the mail.\n\n\"Tech developments are happening very quickly,\" said Gijsbert Bulk, a tax partner at the accounting firm Ernst & Young in Amsterdam. \"Politicians are trying to find a way to tax the digital economy.\"\n\nOne of the European countries most affected by the tax change will be Luxembourg. The small country's low value-added tax rates have enticed Apple to set up its international iTunes business there, and Microsoft's digital download operation is also based there.\n\nLuxembourg's corporate tax system is being challenged by several European investigations into whether politicians gave preferential treatment to the likes of Amazon and a financing unit of Fiat, the Italian carmaker. And Jean-Claude Juncker, Luxembourg's former prime minister, who now runs the executive arm of the European Union responsible for the continuing investigations, has been criticized for his role in promoting the country's low-tax policies.\n\nIn preparation for potential lost income from value-added taxes, Luxembourg's lawmakers have announced an increase in the country's value-added rate on most goods to 17 percent from 15 percent, though it will still offer heavily discounted rates for e-books and some other products.\n\n\"Luxembourg is going to lose an enormous amount of revenue,\" said Karen Robb, a tax partner at the accounting firm Grant Thornton in London. \"There will be fewer compelling tax reasons for companies to stay in Luxembourg.\"", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "wgt":

adage directly applicable to investors seeking new opportunities. The old saying takes on special meaning at this time of year as shareholders look back at their portfolio's performance as a first step in determining what to expect in 2015. After a banner 2014, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) shareholders have much to consider heading into the new year.\n\nAs Intel's share price hovers at or near its 52-week high, it's not surprising that some investors would consider taking their gains and looking for other opportunities. Up about 43% in 2014, the chipmaker has finally given long-suffering shareholders something to cheer about. That's the good news. The really good news is that Intel's stellar share price performance isn't due to rumors or momentum. There are instead fundamental reasons for its strong run, and it doesn't appear those will change heading into 2015.\n\nThe long, winding road\n\nWhen Brian Krzanich was named CEO in May 2013, more than a few Intel fans breathed a sigh of relief. Outgoing CEO Paul Otellini, by his own admission, was slow in moving Intel into the 21st century world of mobile and cloud computing, something Krzanich addressed, figuratively speaking, within moments of taking on his new assignment.\n\nKrzanich's plan was to move \"even faster into ultra-mobility, to lead Intel into the next era.\" That sounded good at the time, but it came back to bite Krzanich and Intel shareholders. The problem? Intel's mobile efforts, particularly when compared to industry leader Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM ) , have performed less than spectacularly, and investors paid the price.\n\nWith close to two-thirds of the cellular chip market, Qualcomm is the undisputed king. Couple Qualcomm's dominant market position with a tepid tablet market, and Intel faced an uphill battle in the hyper-competitive mobile industry from day one. But things began to change, for Intel and its shareholders as it became clear all of the company's eggs weren't in one, mobile basket.\n\nKrzanich has not tossed in the mobile chip towel, nor should he. But Intel does not need to knock Qualcomm off its mobile perch to perform up to investors' standards, as the best third quarter in the company's storied history attests. And investors are likely to see more of the same when Intel announces fourth-quarter results on Jan 15.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nWhat became apparent in 2014 was that Intel is primarily a data server and PC market solutions provider, and that should remain the case heading into the new year. Of Intel's $14.6 billion in revenue last quarter -- an 8% improvement over Q3 2013 -- a whopping $9.2 billion came from the PC group. Until recently, that would have been viewed negatively; after all, PCs are dead, right? Turns out, PC's aren't going away. In fact, the market is stabilizing, which is how Intel was able to grow its Q3 PC-related revenue 9% over the previous year.\n\nIntel's other key division, its data center group, really hit its stride in the third quarter, boosting revenue by 16% to $3.7 billion. The impetus for Intel's strong data center growth has been, and will remain in 2015, the cloud. While companies such as Microsoft and IBM battle over cloud-delivered services, Intel is a dominant player in cloud storage and data-related solutions, aka data centers.\n\nAs revenues from the cloud continue to explode -- IDC predicted spending would reach $56.6 billion in 2014, and climb to over $127 billion in 2018 -- Intel has positioned itself as the data center provider of choice. The company is also positioned well in the high-end, custom chip solutions many of today's cloud providers are demanding. The price of PC chips dropped 4% in 2014, but data center chip prices jumped 10% compared to 2013. It's no wonder Intel's gross margin last quarter improved to 65% from 62.4% in 2013's third quarter.\n\nThrow in $530 million in revenue last quarter -- a 14% improvement compared to the same period of 2013 -- in another exploding market, the Internet of Things, and it's easy to see why more than half the analysts covering Intel have a \"strong buy\" rating on the company. Short interest -- investors betting on a share price decline -- has dropped over 14% the last several weeks, despite Intel bumping up against 52-week highs. That is another indication industry pundits aren't expecting Intel's share price to pull back.\n\nThe day before Krzanich was named CEO barely a year and a half ago, Intel's stock price sat at a dismal $23.99 share. Patient shareholders have been rewarded, and then some in 2014, with the stock closing Dec. 30 at $36.79. And there's no reason to think 2015 will be any different. As for Intel's dividend yield of 2.42%?

In Neowin's scenario, there would not be two different browser UIs; the use of the streamlined Trident engine -- or the existing, backwards-compatible version -- would be automatic and invisible to the user of what the publication thought would be eventually dubbed IE12.\n\nMeanwhile, Foley said that the new browser -- code named \"Spartan\" -- will be included with Windows 10, perhaps as the default, but will also be accompanied by a refreshed IE11. The latter will be offered for those who need backwards compatibility with older websites and more importantly, older Web apps.\n\nA name other than IE for the new browser would not be a surprise: In August Microsoft hinted that it was thinking of just that. \"The discussion I recall seeing was a very recent one [just a few weeks ago]. Who knows what the future holds?\" teased Jonathan Sampson of Microsoft in a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" online discussion, while answering a question about a name change to distance the browser from lingering negative perceptions.\n\nIn the end, it may not matter whether Microsoft forks the browser into two separate applications or just forks the Trident engine. The result would be the same: One browser/engine that goes forward, another browser/engine that remains static as an option primarily for businesses, the customers who most require compatibility with older sites -- mainly their own intranet domains -- and older Web apps used by their employees.\n\nMicrosoft's strategy? To have a fresh start on browsers, and leave the cumbersome legacy support required of IE behind. The browser/engine of the future would be aggressively updated -- as will all of Windows -- while the browser/engine of the past would be maintained but not significantly enhanced.\n\nIf that's the idea, Microsoft's abrupt announcement in August that it was forcing users to upgrade to IE11 makes more sense in hindsight. Then, Microsoft told customers that after Jan. 12, 2016, only IE11 would be supported with security updates on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.\n\nPushing users toward IE11 could thus be seen as the first announced step -- necessary in 2014 to give customers, particularly conservative corporations, time to make the move -- in a broader plan to deemphasize that version as Microsoft prepared to unveil and aggressively promote a new browser or at least a new browser engine.\n\nAccording to analytics vendor Net Applications, IE11 accounted for 43% of all versions of IE run in November, making it the most-used edition.\n\nBy consolidating users on IE11, Microsoft not only reduces its own support costs -- fewer versions of IE to support -- but prepares customers for a future where only IE11 boasts the kind of backward compatibility necessary for enterprises.\n\nOther promises Microsoft made in August back that speculation, as it pledged that the legacy support tool introduced in April, \"Enterprise Mode for Internet Explorer 11,\" would be maintained, improved and supported on Windows 7 through its retirement date of January 14, 2020. By continuing to maintain Enterprise Mode for IE11, Microsoft would be able to tell companies to standardize on that browser if they needed to support legacy websites and apps. Others would be able to move to the new browser -- if Foley is correct -- or use the new lighter-weight Trident engine, assuming Neowin is more on the mark.\n\nA brand new browser, however, would give Microsoft an advantage over offering two rendering engines within one named IE.\n\nHistorically, Microsoft has supported a version of IE until the end of support for the edition of Windows it ran on. Although that policy is now in tatters because of the January 2016 deadline -- IE10's support on Windows 7 was chopped by seven years with that decision -- a new, separate browser as Foley outlined would let Microsoft make even more radical moves.\n\nOther browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, are patched only in their latest versions. Because Google and Mozilla update their browsers every six to eight weeks, users must keep pace or risk running a vulnerable application.\n\nMicrosoft may want to follow in their footsteps: In fact, the FAQ dedicated to the January 2016 deadline noted rivals' practices as a reason for those changes. \"Focusing support on the latest version of Internet Explorer for a supported Windows operating system is in line with industry standards,\" the FAQ read (emphasis added).\n\nA newly-named browser would allow Microsoft to change its support policy for that application to match Chrome's and Firefox's. In other words, if Microsoft releases a browser named \"Spartan,\" it might tell customers that they need to run the latest update to receive patches, then update that browser every few weeks. (In 2014, Microsoft patched IE every month.)\n\nFor those unable to keep up, Microsoft could point them toward IE11 and its Enterprise Mode, which would presumably be provided with patches as usual. Customers would not need to be running only the latest IE11 update to receive more fixes.\n\nThat kind of browser split -- Spartan (or whatever name it's eventually given) on one hand, IE11 on the other -- would match how Microsoft will handle Windows 10: Consumers will receive automatic OS updates, probably monthly, in lieu of occasional upgrades, while businesses will be able to opt for one of two slower tempos.\n\nMore information about Microsoft's Jan. 12, 2016, deadline for upgrading to the newest browser for each version of Windows can be found on the company's website.\n\nMicrosoft has scheduled a press and analyst event for Jan. 21 in Redmond, where it will unveil the next iteration of the Windows 10 preview. That version will focus on consumer features, and may include the new browser or rendering engine.", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "wgt": 4, "time": "18:50:00", "uri": "238008774", "url": "http://www.computerworld.com/article/2863746/what-microsofts-fresh-start-browser-strategy-means.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%253A%2Bcomputerworld%252Fnews%252Ffeed%2B%2528Latest%2Bfrom%2BComputerworld%2529#tk.rss_all", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "What Microsoft's 'fresh start' browser strategy means"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "16234", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade"}}, {"id": "16458", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"id": "16635", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"id": "16640", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing platform"}}, {"id": "16667", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17433", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"id": "17470", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free software"}}, {"id": "17479", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"id": "17492", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"id": "18090", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"id": "18287", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pricing", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pricing"}}, {"id": "19558", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toshiba", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toshiba"}}, {"id": "19970", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"id": "21071", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}}, {"id": "24313", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hewlett-Packard"}}, {"id": "24321", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"id": "27507", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"id": "31652", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"id": "40367", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_(computing)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mouse (computing)"}}, {"id": "41552", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"id": "42295", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"id": "45577", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Chrome"}}, {"id": "54961", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_floor", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price floor"}}, {"id": "75183", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Surface", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface Pro"}}, {"id": "85338", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-touch", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-touch"}}], "categories": [{"id": 70, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 332, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 486, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 547, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 915, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25506927", "source": {"id": "1418", "uri": "gigaom.com", "title": "GigaOM"}, "eventUri": "eng-1245403", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "This holiday season, Microsoft, joining the rest of the Windows world in eschewing further Windows RT tablets, fielded the productivity-oriented 12'' Surface Pro 3. But when it came to licensees, no price floor seemed too low. Microsoft worked with HP and ASUS to introduce a pair of sub-$200 Intel-based Windows PCs designed to go after Chromebooks. (Microsoft calls the category \"cloudbooks\".) While each boasted extensive battery life, their other specs were predictably lackluster, including the lack of a touchscreen, that key component Microsoft once touted as the path to Windows 8's manifest destiny.\n\nAnd if the lack of touch may have served as an impediment to the \"modern\" part of Windows 8.1, HP and Toshiba also offered 7\" Windows-based tablets that were rather unfriendly to the desktop part of Windows 8.1. However, they're available for less than $100, and with certain promotions for less than $70.\n\nThe aggressive pricing, particularly on the tablets, in part reflected Microsoft's decision to drop licensing fees for phones and small tablets in order to more effectively with Google. Largely removing price from the equation laid bare Windows' advantages and challenges versus its Google rivals in laptops (Chromebooks) and tablets (Android).\n\nWhen it comes to Chromebooks, Microsoft has a strong advantage in a rich app library. Intel-based Windows laptops can run Chrome, making these cheap laptops something of a Chromebook Plus even though they trade off computing power for simplicity of operation. Indeed, these cheap Windows laptops serve a wake-up call to Google to make faster progress on its offline capabilities, which remain disjointed.\n\nTiny Windows tablets, though, expose the weakness of the Windows touch app selection compared to Android, which can take advantage of the vast library of smartphone apps without encountering the sparse interfaces that many of these apps exhibit on larger Android tablets. They reinforce the need for Microsoft to get a more touch-friendly version of Office onto Windows.\n\nTaken together, the cheap devices show us the validity and fallacy of the path Microsoft started down with Windows 8. Indeed, Microsoft has one operating system running on disparate devices with different usage cases, but not one where the universal benefits of the platform benefit those platforms equally or even comparably.\n\nThat situation will be tested further in 2015 and beyond with Windows 10 as Microsoft doubles down on the motion of \"one Windows\" -- folding in not only Windows Phone but classes of devices including products ranging from the realm of display-free Internet of Things to 80\" multitouch displays. Microsoft hasn't revealed many details of refinements it expects in its touch interfaces. However, and perhaps most importantly, it has communicated that it wants to end \"the duality\" that plagued Windows 8 and which led to neglect of the desktop in that operating system. The big bet is that a universal application model that spans desktop and tablet interfaces will attract more developer interest than just\n\nBut while that may be a better way to get today's desktop Windows developers to reach over to touch, it doesn't necessarily entice today's iOS and Android smartphone and tablet developers -- many of whom are heavily focused on mobile experiences -- to bring those to an environment that even gracefully transitions to keyboard and mouse. That cheap Windows notebook bought this holiday has worthwhile upgrades in store, but the path is less clear for those small tablets and, even more importantly for Microsoft, Windows phones.", "sim":

The consensus is this -- he's not a product guy. But that doesn't mean he's not a good CEO. People seem to like working for him. I think with a few changes it can all work just fine. And the fact that Twitter is not run by product can be a plus not a minus.\n\nI've never met Costolo. Why is that? I would travel to SF to meet with him. I am a product guy. A lot of the core ideas in Twitter were developed in the blogosphere, and that's where my influence was maximum. Back when we had an open platform that no one controlled. So the first part of cleaning this stuff up, DC should start meeting with people whose ideas he's been building on. Let's start talking. We may not understand each other at first, so we should meet again until we do.\n\nSecond, let's get the developer community going again. It's far from impossible. Twitter has a good API, and the service is a lot more reliable today than it was when it had an excited developer community. I've heard that investors won't back Twitter-based startups. So what. It doesn't take very much money to get something going, esp now that we have services like Heroku and EC2 to build on. I like the idea that I don't have to compete with a bunch of frothy bubble-based startups. And the browser as an app platform has grown enormously. Lots of good new tech to build on if Twitter were more encouraging of developers.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned that it could be an asset for Twitter not to be product-driven. That eliminates basic conflict with developers. A problem every platform has. The more the platform depends on developers, the more concern there is that the employees of the company will interfere. Twitter has, ironically, a great track record there. Unfortunately they nuked the developers. And that's why you see such a dearth of new ideas in the Twitter community.\n\nIt would be easy to re-stoke the fires. Why don't we do that in 2015, rather than the alternative, which is almost certainly Twitter being acquired by Microsoft or Yahoo, the equiv of the Knicks in the software world.

This has upset a lot of users that are still waiting for a touch-first version of the productivity suite for their Windows-powered devices.\n\nThe new strategy of Microsoft may seem to you like a bad idea, but it is actually about getting Office to where the most people are right now, which happens to be on iOS and Android. The company acknowledges that they only have 14 percent device market share but they are working hard on Windows 10 to hopefully change that, with a consumer preview coming this month.\n\nJoe Belfiore has chosen to shed a bit of light into what's in store for Windows Phone via his Weibo account. He reassured users of the platform that the Office team is still working on bringing the productivity suite to the OS, with a Chinese branch working on exclusive features for that country. The Microsoft executive didn't mention an exact date, but said it would be before the Chinese New Year, because they need to align a bundle of announcements.\n\nWith Microsoft holding a Windows 10 event near the end of January, they could choose this venue to announce a touch friendly version of Office for Windows.\n\nOffice isn't going to be enough to close the \"app gap\" that Windows Phone is suffering from, but Microsoft really needs to get it right for its own platform, if it hopes to improve adoption. Recently, the company has announced stats for the mobile operating system in hopes of convincing more developers to start creating apps.\n\nSource: Weibo Via: WindowsBlogItalia", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "wgt": 4, "time": "20:32:00", "uri": "238019298", "url": "http://www.neowin.net/news/joe-belfiore-wants-to-assure-you-office-team-has-not-forgotten-windows-phone", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Joe Belfiore wants to assure you \"Office team has not forgotten Windows Phone\""}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "16351", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"id": "16458", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"id": "16846", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "19139", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"id": "23043", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox Live"}}, {"id": "26655", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Network", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation Network"}}, {"id": "28050", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search warrant"}}, {"id": "40686", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_the_United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement in the United Kingdom"}}, {"id": "46692", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USB flash drive"}}, {"id": "87250", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_group", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hacker group"}}, {"id": "717886", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerstar Golf"}}, {"id": "767802", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Dot", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Dot"}}], "categories": [{"id": 181, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 202, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 581, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 788, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 906, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25511032", "source": {"id": "10140", "uri": "www.onenewspage.com", "title": "One News Page"}, "eventUri": "eng-1242350", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Duration: 00:50s - Published: 2 hours ago\n\nA member of the hacker group Lizard Squad, which claimed credit for taking down Sony's PlayStation Network and Microsoft's Xbox Live on Christmas Day, has been arrested by UK police, according to multiple reports.Daily Dot reports that the man, 22-year-old Vinnie Omari, was arrested Monday after police raided his home.

Here's what Microsoft may have in mind.\n\nMicrosoft will unveil a browser not named Internet Explorer (IE) alongside Windows 10, according to an online report.\n\nLong-time Microsoft watcher and ZDNet blogger Mary Jo Foley cited unnamed sources on Monday to say that the browser would be separate from the existing IE, would sport a minimalist user interface (UI), and would support extensions, sometimes called add-ons, much like Google's Chrome and Mozilla's Firefox.\n\nSeparately, Neowin claimed that Microsoft has forked its Trident browser rendering engine to create a more lightweight version that would be called when IE encounters a modern site, one that doesn't require support for older IE standards. In Neowin's scenario, there would not be two different browser UIs; the use of the streamlined Trident engine -- or the existing, backwards-compatible version -- would be automatic and invisible to the user of what the publication thought would be eventually dubbed IE12.\n\nMeanwhile, Foley said that the new browser -- code named \"Spartan\" -- will be included with Windows 10, perhaps as the default, but will also be accompanied by a refreshed IE11. The latter will be offered for those who need backwards compatibility with older websites and more importantly, older Web apps.\n\nA name other than IE for the new browser would not be a surprise: In August Microsoft hinted that it was thinking of just that. \"The discussion I recall seeing was a very recent one [just a few weeks ago]. Who knows what the future holds?\" teased Jonathan Sampson of Microsoft in a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" online discussion, while answering a question about a name change to distance the browser from lingering negative perceptions.\n\nIn the end, it may not matter whether Microsoft forks the browser into two separate applications or just forks the Trident engine. The result would be the same: One browser/engine that goes forward, another browser/engine that remains static as an option primarily for businesses, the customers who most require compatibility with older sites -- mainly their own intranet domains -- and older Web apps used by their employees.\n\nMicrosoft's strategy? To have a fresh start on browsers, and leave the cumbersome legacy support required of IE behind. The browser/engine of the future would be aggressively updated -- as will all of Windows -- while the browser/engine of the past would be maintained but not significantly enhanced.\n\nIf that's the idea, Microsoft's abrupt announcement in August that it was forcing users to upgrade to IE11 makes more sense in hindsight. Then, Microsoft told customers that after Jan. 12, 2016, only IE11 would be supported with security updates on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.\n\nPushing users toward IE11 could thus be seen as the first announced step -- necessary in 2014 to give customers, particularly conservative corporations, time to make the move -- in a broader plan to deemphasize that version as Microsoft prepared to unveil and aggressively promote a new browser or at least a new browser engine.\n\nAccording to analytics vendor Net Applications, IE11 accounted for 43% of all versions of IE run in November, making it the most-used edition.\n\nBy consolidating users on IE11, Microsoft not only reduces its own support costs -- fewer versions of IE to support -- but prepares customers for a future where only IE11 boasts the kind of backward compatibility necessary for enterprises.\n\nOther promises Microsoft made in August back that speculation, as it pledged that the legacy support tool introduced in April, \"Enterprise Mode for Internet Explorer 11,\" would be maintained, improved and supported on Windows 7 through its retirement date of January 14, 2020. By continuing to maintain Enterprise Mode for IE11, Microsoft would be able to tell companies to standardize on that browser if they needed to support legacy websites and apps. Others would be able to move to the new browser -- if Foley is correct -- or use the new lighter-weight Trident engine, assuming Neowin is more on the mark.\n\nA brand new browser, however, would give Microsoft an advantage over offering two rendering engines within one named IE.\n\nHistorically, Microsoft has supported a version of IE until the end of support for the edition of Windows it ran on. Although that policy is now in tatters because of the January 2016 deadline -- IE10's support on Windows 7 was chopped by seven years with that decision -- a new, separate browser as Foley outlined would let Microsoft make even more radical moves.\n\nOther browsers, including Chrome and Firefox, are patched only in their latest versions. Because Google and Mozilla update their browsers every six to eight weeks, users must keep pace or risk running a vulnerable application.\n\nMicrosoft may want to follow in their footsteps: In fact, the FAQ dedicated to the January 2016 deadline noted rivals' practices as a reason for those changes. \"Focusing support on the latest version of Internet Explorer for a supported Windows operating system is in line with industry standards,\" the FAQ read (emphasis added).\n\nA newly-named browser would allow Microsoft to change its support policy for that application to match Chrome's and Firefox's. In other words, if Microsoft releases a browser named \"Spartan,\" it might tell customers that they need to run the latest update to receive patches, then update that browser every few weeks. (In 2014, Microsoft patched IE every month.)\n\nFor those unable to keep up, Microsoft could point them toward IE11 and its Enterprise Mode, which would presumably be provided with patches as usual.

It doesn't take a scientific study to figure that out - just look at numbers from companies such as Adblock Plus, which claims its software to prevent ads from appearing online has been downloaded 300 million times.\n\nBut could annoying ads online actually cost more - in lost, irritated or disengaged readers - than they're worth?\n\nThat's the question explored in a study from Microsoft Research, to be published in an upcoming issue of the Journal of Marketing Research.\n\nThe study paid roughly 1,223 participants in the United States to engage in a simple online task (categorizing e-mails) and measured how quickly they abandoned the task when an annoying ad was shown at the side of the screen.\n\nWhile people are not paid to visit websites such as those run by newspaper publishers, they do receive value in terms of content they want to see. By paying participants, the researchers hoped to explore how ads could override any sense of value readers may have. The study found that, indeed, participants gave up their task more quickly when they were shown annoying ads.\n\n\"We're basically saying that [publishers] would have to compensate for the ad annoyance with an increased value of the content they're delivering, or the exclusivity of the service they're providing people,\" said Dan Goldstein, a principal researcher at Microsoft. \"It's not really free to run these ads, though it shows up as a short-term profit.\"\n\nThis study is not the first to suggest that there is a cost when people hate ads. According to a survey commissioned by Advertising Standards Canada in 2014, 65 per cent of Canadians have stopped buying a product because they found the company's ads \"unacceptable.\" And people are particularly suspicious of the Web: People rated it the worst in terms of their comfort with truth and accuracy in ads, with pop-up ads online scoring dead last.\n\nOther academic studies have found that annoying ads sometimes make people question how reputable a brand is and can cause them to want to associate less with the brand. An argument could be made that at least annoying ads are memorable. But that doesn't hold up: Research has shown people actually may be less likely to remember them.\n\nWhat has not been explored is the actual cost of these types of ads.\n\nThe study began with a set-up experiment that showed people real online ads and asked them to rate them on a scale based on how annoying (or not) they were. Factors such as animation in the ad, and bad aesthetics, were common reasons for a bad rating. Once that was established, the researchers studied the impact of the annoying ones on a group of people paid to carry out the e-mail categorization task, versus two other groups doing the same, who were shown non-annoying ads or no ads at all.\n\nPeople doing the task looked at one e-mail per page, and each page had two banner ads on either side - either two annoying ones, or two that were not annoying - or just white space in the margins.\n\nThe researchers experimented with different levels of pay per e-mail the participants reviewed; unsurprisingly, people who were paid more looked at more pages. But in every case, people shown annoying ads looked at fewer pages than people in the same pay scale who were shown non-annoying or no ads.\n\nThe math tells a troubling tale: Looking at the behaviours across pay scales, people in this experiment who saw bad ads had to be paid .115 cents more per page to match the level of work done by someone shown good ads, and .135 cents more to match the level of someone shown no ads at all.\n\nThat may not sound like a lot (the pay per-page for the task was relatively low because it took so little time to do), but when expanded to the cost per thousand impressions (CPM or cost-per-mille) - the metric by which ads are commonly sold - it is significant. It comes out to $1.15 CPM difference between bad ads and good ads. Considering that the CPMs of many online ads can be very low, depending on a number of factors, the revenue they provide to publishers may be outstripped by users dropping off their sites.\n\n\"It's like a microcosm in which running annoying ads is the wrong decision,\" Mr. Goldstein said. \"By analogy, we think it's plausible that this could also transfer to actual websites. ... It's not just the domain of the low-rent publishers. A high-profile publisher might be asked to run even a tasteful takeover ad on the main page, where the screen would be covered up for maybe 20 seconds and then people could carry on to read the site. ... These kind of interruptive ads are becoming more prevalent.\"\n\nThis consideration arguably will be more important as people continue to access the Web more often from mobile devices.\n\n\"I've already seen annoying mobile ads show up on apps that I run,\" Mr. Goldstein said. \"You open a weather app and something shows up on the bottom 20 per cent of the screen. ... Because of the limited screen size on a mobile device, you often see these interruptive ads as opposed to ads that appear next to the content. Those might even be more annoying. It's an open question, but it's certainly one that should be looked at.\"\n\n2. Negative psychological impact: Annoying,\" \"distracting\"\n\n4.

"LOTS of cool new technology products come out every year, but usually only a few stand out. These few, though, are often mind-bending -- they alter your perspective of what's possible in the future. There were four such technologies for me in 2014:\n\nDJI INSPIRE 1 Imagine taking control of an evil dragonfly that can record everything it sees. Then you'll have some approximation of what it's like to fly the Inspire 1, a remote-controlled quadricopter released in the fall by the drone-maker DJI. The machine, which sells for about $3,000, is agile and powerful when in flight and offers a few unusual features. Its attached high-definition camera hangs a few inches underneath its body, allowing it to capture an unobstructed picture in any direction. The bird can be operated by two remote controls -- one to control flight, and the other to control the camera.\n\nRomeo Durscher, a drone pilot who works at DJI, let me take control of the Inspire 1 during a test flight over the San Francisco peninsula just before Thanksgiving. As he described all the serious uses for the bird -- especially for photographers and videographers who've long yearned for a cheap alternative to helicopters for aerial imagery -- I became hooked. It's hard to think of a more visceral pleasure in tech than a machine that can dart across the sky at your will. Welcome to the terrifying thrill of the drone age.\n\nOCULUS RIFT'S CRESCENT BAY In March, Facebook announced that it would spend $2 billion to acquire Oculus, a start-up whose virtual-reality headset has generated huge interest. The company's progress since then has cemented the logic of the acquisition: Oculus's virtual-reality tech just keeps getting more and more realistic.\n\nOne huge problem in virtual reality is motion sickness. If your eyes see a picture that looks just slightly out of sync with your perception of motion, you're going to feel a little queasy. In September, Oculus showed its latest prototype, Crescent Bay, that can track a user's head in a complete 360-degree swivel, allowing for a sense of being immersed in a picture that observers called \"mind-blowing.\" When I tested an earlier prototype alongside a more sophisticated virtual-reality machine at Stanford University in the fall, I felt pretty much the same thing. Virtual reality sounds like a gimmick, until you try it; then you'll understand why, in the future, we might often escape reality.\n\nSKYPE TRANSLATOR The universal translator that can automatically bridge any language barrier has long been a staple of science fiction. Now it's almost here, at least in a limited, but still quite impressive, demonstration. Skype, the popular video-calling service owned by Microsoft, unveiled in December a preview version of Skype Translator, which performs near-instantaneous voice translation between people speaking English and Spanish. You can call up a business contact in Mexico and say, \"Hello,\" and she'll hear a friendly, Siri-like voice say, \"Hola!\" on the other end.\n\nBut it goes deeper. In Microsoft's demonstration, students in Mexico City and Tacoma, Wash., were able to understand each other well enough to play a guessing game. After trying out the preview, Peter Bright, a writer at Ars Technica, called it \"breathtaking.\" He added: \"It's like science fiction has come to life.\"\n\nSkype Translator is the product of Microsoft's deep investments in machine learning and natural-language processing. Because those processes only get better as more people use them, services like Skype Translator are bound to get much better.\n\nGOOGLE'S IMAGE SUMMARIES A few young men in shorts and T-shirts are standing on a wide-open green field, all posed as if they're in motion, and between then, in midair, is a small white orb that appears to be made out of plastic and seems to be spinning. How would you describe this scene in a few words? If you're human, it likely won't take you more than a few milliseconds to come up with a caption: \"A group of young people playing a game of Frisbee.\"\n\nBut if you're a computer, translating such an image into words has long been out of reach. Until now. In November, Google showed off the results of an artificial intelligence project that can look at an image consisting of common items and describe, in comprehensible English words, what's going on in the picture -- often with startling accuracy. Given a picture of two pizzas sitting on a white kitchen stove, the machine spit out, \"Two pizzas sitting on top of a stovetop oven.\" It did as well identifying a group of elephants, a guy riding a dirt bike and thousands of other such images.\n\nThe system uses a neural network, an artificial intelligence system that mimics the human brain, and which Google has used, in the past, to identify cats in YouTube videos. It still isn't perfect, though. Given a picture of a road sign covered in stickers, the computer saw \"a refrigerator filled with lots of food and drinks.\"", "sim": 0, "wgt": 2, "time": "22:05:00", "uri": "238028365", "url": "http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/01/01/technology/personaltech/standouts-in-tech-drones-virtual-reality-instant-translation-and-ai.html?_r=3&referrer=", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Standouts in Tech: Drones, Virtual Reality, Instant Translation and A.I. - NYTimes.com"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "China"}, "type": "loc", "score": 2, "id": "44", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"id": "16175", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photograph"}}, {"id": "16308", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer network"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17449", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High-definition television"}}, {"id": "18687", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camera"}}, {"id": "19876", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"id": "20554", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LTE (telecommunication)"}}, {"id": "22661", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Communications Commission"}}, {"id": "23841", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"id": "24216", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"id": "25004", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Optics"}}, {"id": "27510", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"id": "43954", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Specification (technical standard)"}}, {"id": "44029", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"id": "64676", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Level of detail"}}, {"id": "65900", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}}, {"id": "66073", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OLED"}}, {"id": "70583", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(photography)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flash (photography)"}}, {"id": "75151", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_(system_on_chip)", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snapdragon (system on chip)"}}, {"id": "76274", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_Advanced", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LTE Advanced"}}, {"id": "718256", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nokia Lumia"}}, {"id": "720088", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Phone", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Windows Phone"}}, {"id": "736788", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A7_MPCore", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ARM Cortex-A7"}}], "categories": [{"id": 337, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 500, "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 960, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25513019", "source": {"id": "6736", "uri": "www.gsmarena.com", "title": "GSMArena.com"}, "eventUri": "eng-1242095", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "In the first day of the new year, the upcoming Microsoft Lumia 1330/1335 has made an appearance in China.

excessive control over social media made international headlines last week. The state media oversight agency, at the request of prosecutors, forced the popular social network Facebook to block a support page for a Russian opposition leader and prominent anti-corruption activist, Alexei Navalny, who is on trial in a case he has called politically motivated.\n\nBut that is only the tip of the iceberg. Many social media users are finding themselves in trouble with the Russian authorities for joining groups, getting tagged, and sharing content on social media sites.\n\nWho among us has not been tagged in an unflattering photo or an offensive post? It might lead us to wonder why we took that group picture after midnight or raise some eyebrows at work. It might also make us regret the evaporation of privacy. But it should not lead to legal trouble with the authorities. Yet this is precisely what happened to a woman in Perm, Russia.\n\nIn September, Yevgeniya Vychigina was prosecuted and fined for being tagged by a friend in a so-called \"extremist\" video on the Russian social media site VKontakte. Featuring interviews with self-styled \"partisans\" who attacked police officers, the video was undeniably controversial. Yet Vychigina was no partisan. She was neither in the video nor supported the video's message.\n\nHer friend simply wanted her to watch it, and she claims to have accepted the tag without watching the video. After she accepted the video, it appeared on Vychigina's Vkontakte page, leading a court to fine her for \"disseminating extremist materials.\" The case reveals the absurd and alarming scope of Internet censorship in Russia.\n\nGetting tagged did not always get you in trouble. Only in the past two years have the Russian authorities \"gone digital\" with their crackdown against independent voices. Successful online organizing around the world has undoubtedly shaken them, so now they are using a range of vague laws, such as Russia's 2002 anti-extremism law, to police the net.\n\nIn 2012, the Duma passed an Internet censorship law that gives authorities the power to extrajudicially block websites that feature content prohibited in Russia, including \"extremist materials\" - the definition of which is left up to prosecutors to decide.\n\nThe law tasks Roskomnadzor, Russia's state agency for media oversight, with maintaining a blacklist of banned sites and ensuring that Russia's Internet-service providers block access accordingly.\n\nTh authorities 'grip over the net tightened this year, when the Duma passed a personal data law requiring all Internet companies to store Russian users' data within the country's borders by September 2015. Just how this will work for companies based in places like California is anyone's guess.\n\nA series of amendments to Russia's anti-extremism legislation was also passed this year, including a law requiring bloggers to register with the authorities if they have over 3,000 visitors to their site a day. Another amendment increases sentences for those found guilty of broadly and vaguely defined \"extremist activity,\" which the authorities have made clear applies to those who might post, like, share, or get tagged in provocative content online.\n\nIn March, Russia blocked three major opposition news websites (EJ.ru, Kasparov.ru, and Grani.ru) and the popular LiveJournal blog of Alexei Navalny. Critical voices across the political spectrum have been targeted - not just the most prominent. In February 2013, a nationalist in Kazan was fined for publishing anti-Tatar comments and criticizing local authorities on the social network Moi Mir.\n\nPeople who do not even intend to criticize the government have also found themselves caught in this online crackdown. An amateur political researcher in the Urals, for example, was prosecuted for simply sharing a video by Pravy Sector (Right Sector), a far-right wing Ukrainian group that shot to fame in the Maidan protests, on his VKontakte page. He claims to have shared the video for the purposes of his research and said he did not support its message.\n\nAt times, the authorities have gone so far as to block entire websites for minor content infractions. In addition to these bans, companies must also navigate the impending data law. It's not just dissidents who are affected, it's businesses too: Google and Microsoft have already partially closed operations in Russia, and Adobe has left entirely.\n\nSome of Russia's regulatory steps appear valid. Websites advocating acts of terrorism or featuring child pornography may be validly blocked. A major problem, however, is that there are no limits to material that might be considered \"extremist,\" which, unsurprisingly, has led to violations of free speech. This February, a woman in Bashkortostan was fined for posting inflammatory \"extremist\" comments on Facebook about Russian sunbathers in Turkey. In 2013, a YouTube video showing viewers how to apply Halloween makeup was banned for \"promoting suicide.\" Almost 10,000 pages and sites have been banned since 2012.\n\nDespite the cost and impracticalities of online censorship, the Russian government is committed to expanding it. The Interior Ministry is offering 3.9 million rubles (about $ 65,000) to anyone who can identify and analyze users of Tor, a server that allows anonymity in browsing and circumvents firewalls. Tor is designed to protect people like political dissidents who risk reprisal unless they speak anonymously, but Russian authorities put its users on par with criminals.\n\nRussia should be guaranteeing the rights of free speech and conscience by loosening censorship and ensuring its law enforcement agencies are pursuing legitimate security concerns online, not wasting time harassing activists - or those who simply happen to get tagged in an unfortunate video.", "sim": 0.6078431606292725, "wgt": 2, "time": "22:24:00", "uri": "238029043", "url": "http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/514020.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+themoscowtimes%2FRUXi+%28The+Moscow+Times%29&utm_content=FeedBurner+user+view", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "Don't Get Tagged on Social Media in Russia"}, {"lang": "eng", "date": "2015-01-01", "duplicateList": [], "concepts": [{"id": "15943", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiking", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hiking"}}, {"id": "16038", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"id": "16677", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"id": "16751", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_developer", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game developer"}}, {"id": "17131", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human"}}, {"id": "17224", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"id": "17242", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"id": "17433", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"id": "18090", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"id": "18686", "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"id": "24321", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"id": "24999", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"id": "27392", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Porting"}}, {"id": "27711", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"id": "29888", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamer"}}, {"id": "40673", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox 360"}}, {"id": "40797", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_kit", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software development kit"}}, {"id": "56529", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_video", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High-definition video"}}, {"id": "92503", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_vision", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Night vision"}}, {"id": "201495", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VG_Chartz", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "VG Chartz"}}, {"id": "256923", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kinect"}}, {"id": "717886", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerstar Golf"}}, {"id": "722874", "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Store", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windows Store"}}], "categories": [{"id": 44, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 70, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating Systems", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 92, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 486, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 547, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"id": 915, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 100}], "id": "25514442", "source": {"id": "1270", "uri": "www.gamekicker.com", "title": "www.gamekicker.com"}, "eventUri": "eng-1243604", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "#GamerGate Mostly Left-Leaning Liberals, According To Survey\n\nMicrosoft released the Xbox One Kinect for Windows in October of this year.

The response of the developer community to Kinect v2 has been tremendous: every day, we see amazing apps built on the capabilities of the new sensor and SDK, and since we released the public beta of SDK 2.0 in July, the community has been telling us that porting their original solutions over to v2 is smoother and faster than expected.\"\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nA life-long and avid gamer, William D'Angelo was first introduced to VGChartz in 2007.

that long-neglected project-- digitizing your old analog photos and archiving them. Scanning is still the most efficient, and affordable way to do that.\n\nMany of you may be wondering--do people still scan photos anymore? Aren't we in the digital age?\n\nThat was my thought, as I started pulling even more old photos out of the closet to get archived in the new year. I had a full box's worth, and brought them down to Scanmyphotos.com here, a business that does nothing but scan old photos, negative and slides for folks.\n\nScanmyphotos has digitized over 250 million photos over the last 5 years, \"which may sound like a lot,\" the company's president Mitch Goldstone told me. \"But there are still 3 and a half trillion analog photos, spanning multiple generations. So it's huge.\"\n\nThe cheapest and most economical way to scan your old photos is to buy a scanner--most printers selling for as little as $100 come with scanners these days. The problem is that the process is very slow. Put the picture in the scanner, press scan on your computer, save the file, and then start again.\n\nMost Federal Express Office locations have the Sony Imagestation kiosk in store, which will let you scan up to 100 photos at one time onto a CD (remember those?) for as little as $5. Great price, but plan to put in at least an hour standing over the kiosk while you do the scanning.\n\nWhich brings us to scanmyphotos. Goldstone offers bulk scans of up to 1,800 photos for $99, or 16 cents per photos. You will put in the work here too. Once you pay, you get sent a box, which you have to stuff with photos.\n\nBut first, you have to put in the time for organization. All the 4x6s, 5x7s, 8x10s, etc. must be separated and marked. Photos have to be pulled out of frames and albums.\n\nOther options: Digmypics charges 39 cents per print, while iMemories.com is 49 cents per image. What makes iMemories different is that it puts the scanned photos online. It charges $5.99 monthly to use the online service, but has a free 30-day trial for it--during which time the client can download the images directly from the website.\n\nYou can also download one of the many, many apps or scanning photos (including Pic Scanner or Cam Scanner) directly to your smartphone, but let's face it--do you really expect the teeny smartphone camera to do as good a job as a full service scanner?\n\nIt's okay for a few photos, but I wouldn't lean on an app to archive my most important memories.\n\nIf you have the photos scanned professionally, be prepared to put in some time organizing them when they're returned, as they'll be named things like 00001.jpg and 00002.jpg. Once in your computer you can plan to put in a few hours creating new folders with the files. (For instance: Hawaii trip 2012, Jimmy's second birthday) or look to software to help out.\n\nBoth Apple's iPhoto and Google's Picasa for Windows computers have excellent \"Faces\" features. This too will take a bit of time, but after you've imported the photos, click the Faces tab, and help Apple and Google learn everyone's face.\n\nSo when it comes time for finding photos of Uncle Bernie and Aunt Clara, you should be able to locate them instantly.\n\nThe reasons for archiving are so numerous. Just look back at 2014, and remember every natural disaster, every hurricane, freak storm, fire and such, and remember the person running for the one possession that meant more than anything else--the old photo album.\n\nArchiving old photos is priceless.\n\nOnce they're copied and organized, the last step is to save them in multiple places.\n\nThe obvious first step is to make a second copy of the photos onto a USB drive or hard drive, and store that outside your home--in a safety deposit vault or a friend or relatives house.\n\nDespite the endless hack attacks that we witnessed in 2014, many folks prefer to have the photos backed up online, safe and secure, and available at the click of a mouse.\n\n(You really think a dictator from some far away country is interested in your vacation photos?)\n\nBoth Google Drive and Microsoft's OneDrive have the simplest, most affordable options:\n\n--They both offer 15 Gigbytes of backup storage for free. Which sounds great--but that's just a starting point. This year (I know I'm abnormal this way) easily shot over 1 terabyte of photos and videos.\n\nGoogle offers 1 TB of online storage for $9.99 yearly, while Microsoft isn't as generous at $84 for the same amount of storage.\n\nAn ad-free solution worth considering is photo sharing website Smugmug, which offers unlimited uploads starting at $39.99 yearly. You can create galleries and share on social media with a prettier display than Google or Microsoft, which are meant as back-up, not presentation options.\n\nFinally, once the photos are scanned, Goldstone says you'll be in great shape for the social media phenomeon of #TBT (Throwback Thursday.)\n\n\"It's not just new photos that are shared on social media, but old ones too,\" he says. \"People love seeing the nostalgia.\"\n\nFollow Jefferson Graham on Twitter\n\n59 CONNECT 35 TWEET 5 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1B9s9rl", "sim":

and Mail"}, "eventUri": "eng-1247576", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "It has been the strangest kind of charm offensive.\n\nChina, the country that perfected breaking the Internet, has of late been on a campaign to convince the rest of the world that its approach to digital networks is worth spreading. It's an effort led by Lu Wei, the man whose chief responsibilities include overseeing the Great Firewall of China, whose heavy veil of censorship is responsible for the damage China has done to the Internet inside its borders.\n\nIn November, Mr. Lu was among the headline speakers at China's first-ever World Internet Conference, which featured corporate guests from around the globe. In December, he flew to Silicon Valley and visited Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos. He appeared at a Washington Internet forum co-hosted by Microsoft and attended by senior U.S. officials. A few days later, he published an article in the Huffington Post that, in a tidy 1,397 words, laid out China's vision for what the Internet should look like.\n\nIt's a dramatic change from China's historically favoured way of expressing its Internet views: the silent display of error messages instead of websites it doesn't like, the deletion of social media posts it considers improper and the banning of foreign companies that won't toe its line. The latest appears to be Google, whose search and Gmail products have been largely blocked since late spring.\n\nBut Mr. Lu, who leads the Cyberspace Administration of China, is on a new mission to convert others to his vision of how the Internet should be run: that digital networks should not allow the unimpeded flow of information, but should instead fall under the \"cybersovereignty\" of individual nations.\n\nThe Internet should be \"free and open, with rules to follow and always following the rule of law,\" he said, in somewhat contradictory fashion, at the November conference. Asked whether he would consider allowing Facebook in, he was more direct: \"I can choose who will be a guest in my home.\" He wants others to assert the same power.\n\nIt's a controversial notion, since China has used its control of the Internet to silence dissent, spread propaganda and delete chapters of history . It has also exported its firewall technology to others, notably to African regimes looking for their own god-like powers over online content.\n\nMr. Lu's charm offensive suggests the rest of the world must prepare for a more concerted effort by China to export its Internet governance model as well. In a recent column in state media, Fang Xingdong noted that China increasingly has the \"hard power\" to exert its will.\n\n\"China boasts the largest number of Internet users and also world famous companies like Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu. The Chinese market will be critical in reshaping the cyberlandscape in the next decade,\" wrote Mr. Fang, director of the Centre for Internet and Society at Zhejiang University of Media and Communications.\n\nChina of course has little authority over the Internet outside its borders. But it wields considerable control over companies eager to profit from its massive population - and that can have global consequences.\n\nLinkedIn is among the only social media sites that operates in China, but its agreement to censor content sensitive to Beijing has led to it blocking posts from users in the United States. Microsoft search engine Bing has similarly come under fire for censoring searches on its Chinese-language service that originated outside China.\n\n\"It's a bigger problem than most people even imagine,\" said Rogier Creemers, a research officer at the University of Oxford Centre for Socio-Legal Studies.\n\n\"On a topic that might well be the most important story of our time, being the re-emergence of China, we are reliant upon privately owned communications platforms, some of which are trying to get in China's good graces.\"\n\nAnd even Western governments are sculpting the data they allow in: Britain has notably built a wide-ranging filter to intercept child pornography.\n\nMany nations are also newly skeptical of U.S. leadership in cyberspace, following the Edward Snowden revelations of rampant spying. \"The U.S. is no longer seen as a benevolent steward of the Internet system,\" said Mr. Creemers.\n\n\"The whole idea that Cisco routers, which power the Chinese Internet, might have CIA backdoors installed is a huge concern in Chinese policy circles.\" China appears to be taking swift action, saying it wants home-grown technology to supplant foreign-sourced goods in sensitive banking, military and other applications by 2020.\n\nThat action underscores the risk to western corporations of China's new Internet assertiveness.\n\nCritics says there are risks, too, in the Chinese philosophical model - one that suggests governments should be assertive in controlling information - gaining adherents elsewhere.\n\n\"If we think about the role the Internet has played in the Arab spring, the attempts by those countries to try to limit access to that information is hugely important,\" said Michael Geist, a law professor and privacy expert at the University of Ottawa.\n\n\"People who look to the Internet as having the potential to embody a new globalized communication structure where there is access to information in every corner in ways that wasn't possible before - that vision takes a pretty big hit when we see what's actually unfolding in some countries, and China is a huge player in that.\"\n\nStill, some suggest China itself is changing.\n\n\"We think the Firewall is a stopgap arrangement, whose function will diminish as Chinese cyberspace becomes more developed. Being an open society has become one of China's core beliefs,\" the Communist-run Global Times wrote in an editorial this week.\n\nAnd the very structure of the Internet - with vast numbers of interconnected humans - suggests even technological barriers erected by government will only be partly effective. After all, anyone with even modest technical skill can still access Facebook, or the Wikipedia history of the Tiananmen massacre, inside China today.\n\n\"I don't mean to say that it's not worrying, or it's not eventually going to be a problem,\" said Ren Bucholz, a Toronto lawyer who serves on the advisory board for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group that advocates for privacy and free expression online.\n\n\"But I don't know what I would do if I was in [China's] position and trying to map out a strategy for how to control the Internet. I really think that's a difficult ask, even for a supervillain.\"", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "wgt": 2, "time": "23:07:00", "uri": "238033717", "url":

class-action suit accusing the company of deliberately misleading consumers on how much storage is available on 16 gigabyte iPhones and iPads.\n\nThe suit blames iOS 8 for taking up too much storage space on devices, and it accuses Apple of trying to force customers to buy the company's iCloud service to make up for the lacking storage.\n\nThe complaint claims users have access to approximately 20 percent less storage on more recent iPhone and iPad models than what was marketed on the box.\n\nThe complaint reads, \"Using these sharp business tactics, [Apple] gives less storage capacity than advertised, only to offer to sell that capacity in a desperate moment,\" and \"To put this in context, each gigabyte of storage Apple shortchanges its customers amounts to approximately 400-500 high resolution photographs.\"\n\nBut a Forbes writer notes the plaintiffs \"are on shaky ground when they assert that Apple doesn't appear to permit 'users of its devices to access cloud storage from other vendors.'\"\n\nThat's because there are services like Instagram and Flickr where people can store thousands of photos, and other cloud storage systems like Dropbox and Google Drive offer free storage on a limited amount of data -- all of which are available on Apple products.\n\nApple has been sued for misleading consumers about storage space before. In 2007, a Canadian law student filed a complaint over the space available on the iPod Nano. That suit was eventually dropped.\n\nMicrosoft has also been accused of being misleading with its Surface Pro tablets, with some users claiming they only had access to about half of the storage space advertised.\n\nThis latest lawsuit against Apple comes not long after the tech giant won another legal battle over the price of the iPod.", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "wgt": 3, "time": "00:23:00",

Times"}, "eventUri": "eng-1242616", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "Accelerators, as the automotive term denotes, are meant to impart momentum. In the startup world, accelerators help young ventures step on the gas in their journey to becoming the next big company. While startups have proliferated -- more than two new ventures are set up every day in India -- so have the accelerators. But the problem is that only a few of the accelerators have the power to help, which means that many startups with good ideas could go without the backing they need.\n\nThis is because the successful among the accelerators will back only the very best among the startups, leading to concerns that this does not bode well for Indian entrepreneurship. On the other hand, accelerators believe this is inevitable because the most promising startups have to be given the best chance.\n\n\"Startups should have a velocity before they get accelerated,\" said Ravi Narayan, who heads Microsoft Ventures in Bangalore, the two-year-old accelerator programme that was ranked No. 1 in an ET survey last week. \"This way, prospective customers take the companies more seriously,\" he said.\n\nOver the past two years, more than 80 accelerators and incubators -- these support the earliest of earlystage ideas -- have come up in India. But less than a dozen are good enough to be of any real use, and these are wary of backing startups without customers or revenue. The top accelerators ET spoke with say they will focus on startups in the late stages, causing soul-searching in the industry. The task of working with early-stage companies will soon be passed on to incubators that are mostly housed in academic institutions and don't have the industry networks that the accelerators do.\n\n\"It is becoming the trend now. Going forward we will be looking at slightly mature companies,\" said Abhishek Mitra Gupta, the head of TLabs, which is run by Times Internet, a part of the Times Group that publishes The Economic Times. The threeyear old accelerator has backed companies such as YouTube marketing and analytics suite Vidooly and mobile browser Flynx. Broadly speaking, accelerators straighten out a startup's business model, offer space and extend other support in developing the product, connect startups to mentors and help entrepreneurs get face time with investors. But that seems to be happening at a very superficial level for most startups.\n\n\"There is a tremendous amount of blind leading the blind going on in India,\" said Sramana Mitra, a strategy consultant for startups. Mitra runs a global virtual incubator that aims to help one million entrepreneurs globally to reach $1 million in revenue and beyond. The top accelerators include TLabs, Delhi-based multi-city accelerator GSF and year-old Kyron founded by former Target CEO Lalit Ahuja. Some of these typically take an average of 8-10% equity for an investment of $50,000 (Rs 30 lakh). Microsoft Ventures does not take any equity in its companies.\n\nIn an ET survey last week, where over 100 industry respondents participated, GSF and TLabs grabbed the second and third spots respectively.\n\nThe four accelerators have so far supported 155 startups such as security software maker AppKnox and fitness app HealthifyMe. Two of the high-profile acquisitions - app performance tool Little Eye Labs by Facebook and document handling tool maker BookPad by Yahoo last year--came from these accelerators. While GSF backed LittleEyeLabs, BookPad was accelerated at Kyron and Microsoft Ventures.\n\nBut the spurt in the number of accelerators has changed the dynamics in the industry. Just as the successful accelerators are becoming choosy, so the successful startups are being courted by accelerators. \"Three years ago startups would chase accelerators,\" said Laxman Papineni, cofounder of AppVirality, which was a part of the Microsoft Ventures last year. \"Now accelerators chase startups.\"\n\nAnd most accelerators, say industry insiders, offer little more than physical space for startups to operate. \"While they're giving them the next set of customers and the industry connect, we're not sure if they are helping them go to the next orbit,\" said Guhesh Ramananthan, cofounder of Excubator, a year-old accelerator which picks a few startups to work with for a period of one year. Large companies such as Intel, Microsoft and Nokia have reached out to Excubator, showing interest in its portfolio companies.\n\nTo improve the standard of service, top accelerators recently decided to streamline their efforts. The decision to focus on late-stage companies came during a closed-door meeting with a dozen accelerators at the Microsoft Ventures office in November -- a get-together meant to learn the best practices from one another.\n\nBut such practices, including focusing on certain verticals like digital media and mobile, have other fallouts, say experts. \"In some ways it's a restricted intake. But you are also focusing on bringing more value add to the startups,\" said Ahuja of Kyron. And investors maintain that they view both accelerated and nonaccelerated companies with the same lens.\n\n\"While accelerators and incubators prove to be great discovery platforms for startups, it is not a criterion we look at when looking at potential investments,\" said Rutvik Doshi of Inventus Capital Partners. All the 13 companies that Inventus has invested in over the past two years have not been accelerated.\n\nSumanth HR of Deck.in, a graduate of Microsoft Ventures and a developer of new-age powerpoints, said the trend is such that top investors don't give any special attention to startups from top accelerators. Entrepreneurs argue that running accelerators has now become a business and several disapprove of the trend.\n\nAkshay Kingar, CEO of mobile app development firm Foofys, says startups need to spend as much time as possible with their customers working on the latest technology, instead of following a schedule set up by an accelerator. The fouryear-old firm is on track to post sales of Rs 1.5 crore by the end of this year.\n\nWhile accelerators are credited for shaping Indian entrepreneurship, there is still a lot left to be done. And there are signs. To prevent entrepreneurs hopping from one accelerator to another, Microsoft Ventures is identifying core competencies of accelerators -- TLabs for digital media, Microsoft for social media, analytics and cloud, and such like.\n\nTo help early-stage companies, Microsoft is in discussions with incubators, and some like The Startup Centre in Chennai are running a pre-accelerator programme. Ahuja of Kyron said things can only get better, since everyone is continually trying to reinvent and come up with a breakthrough model that works for startups and themselves.\n\n\"Indian accelerators provide a much more immersive experience than their counterparts in the Silicon Valley,\" he said. \"There is a greater optimism that the model is here to stay.\"", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "wgt": 3, "time": "00:31:00", "uri": "238040877", "url": "http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-01-02/news/57611443_1_abhishek-mitra-gupta-accelerators-microsoft-ventures", "location": null, "image": null, "title": "How top accelerators are becoming choosy about the startups they back"}]
